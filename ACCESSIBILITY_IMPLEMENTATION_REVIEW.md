# Accessibility Implementation Review

## Executive Summary

Accessibility coverage has improved meaningfully across the modern webapp: the high-contrast theme now loads, navigation landmarks and skip links are in place, and modal focus management has been tightened. However, recent UI additions (Search history suggestions, the keyboard shortcuts overlay, the OCR status chip) were introduced without a dedicated accessibility pass, and automated guardrails are still missing. The next iteration should focus on validating these new surfaces, strengthening dynamic announcements, and instituting ongoing accessibility verification.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Implemented Correctly

1. **ARIA Labels in Landing + Navigation**: The landing page and `Sidebar.tsx` expose ARIA labels/landmarks, including `role="navigation"`, `aria-label` annotations, and `aria-current` on active nav items.

2. **Skip Link + Main Landmark**: `App.tsx` now renders a skip-to-content link targeting the main region, improving keyboard bypass for repetitive navigation.

3. **High Contrast Mode Wiring**:
   - `settingsStore.ts` persists the `highContrast` flag and `App.tsx` keeps the `high-contrast` class in sync
   - `high-contrast.css` is imported in `main.tsx`, making the theme toggle effective

4. **Modal Focus Management**:
   - `AccessibilityPanel.tsx` and `FolderModal.tsx` manage focus trapping, initial focus, and Escape handling

5. **TopBar Controls**:
   - Core TopBar actions expose aria labels/tooltips, and the OCR chip now includes inline status text plus a focusable action button

### What's Missing or Incomplete

1. **Dynamic Announcements**:
   - Search results count, OCR status changes, and background index updates are not surfaced through `aria-live` regions
   - The new Search history suggestions list lacks explicit ARIA roles/state to communicate selection or result metadata

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts Panel**:
   - `KeyboardShortcutsPanel.tsx` renders an overlay without focus trapping or heading hierarchy for screen readers; keyboard users can tab to page content underneath

3. **Keyboard Navigation Coverage**:
   - The Search suggestions list and advanced filter accordions still rely on mouse interactions; arrow key handling and `aria-expanded` instrumentation remain TODOs

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Manual audits for color-blind modes and high-contrast combinations have not been recorded
   - No automated accessibility regressions tests (axe, pa11y, Storybook a11y checks) are wired into CI

5. **Documentation Drift**:
   - Accessibility guidance in Storybook/docs does not yet mention the new OCR chip, keyboard shortcuts panel, or search history experience

## Detailed Implementation Gaps

### 1. Dynamic Content Announcements
**Issue**: Users relying on assistive tech do not receive updates when search suggestions, OCR counts, or index status change.

**Evidence**:
- `SearchBar.tsx` renders suggestion rows without `role="listbox"/"option"` semantics or live announcements for “n results” updates.
- The OCR chip updates text visually but does not fire polite announcements when status changes.
- Indexing progress toasts remain purely visual.

**Impact**: Screen reader users may miss context changes, leading to confusion when background operations finish.

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts Overlay
**Issue**: The full-screen shortcuts panel does not trap focus and lacks semantic grouping.

**Evidence**:
- `KeyboardShortcutsPanel.tsx` renders a focusable close button, but Tab continues into page content underneath.
- Category headers are rendered as plain `<h3>` elements within a grid; no `role="dialog"` or `aria-modal` present.

**Impact**: Keyboard users can inadvertently interact with underlying UI; screen reader users may not realise a modal is open.

### 3. Search + Filters Keyboard Semantics
**Issue**: Suggestion navigation and accordion toggles are mouse-first.

**Evidence**:
- Search suggestion rows are `<div>` elements activated via `onMouseDown`; arrow key navigation is not announced nor tied to `aria-activedescendant`.
- Advanced filter section headers gained `role="button"` but do not manage `aria-expanded` or keyboard activation beyond click.

**Impact**: Users relying on keyboard cannot confidently explore suggestions or understand expanded state.

### 4. Testing + Regression Tooling
**Issue**: Accessibility verification remains manual.

**Evidence**:
- No Vitest/Playwright hooks running axe-core.
- Docs mention recommendations but CI scripts do not enforce them.

**Impact**: Future regressions (for example, from the current SearchBar overhaul) may slip in unnoticed.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Instrument Dynamic Updates**:
   - Introduce `aria-live="polite"` announcements for OCR completion, indexing milestones, and search result counts.
   - Convert search suggestion markup to `role="combobox"` + `listbox`/`option` semantics with keyboard support for `ArrowUp/Down`, `Enter`, `Escape`.

2. **Harden Keyboard Shortcuts Panel**:
   - Wrap overlay in a `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"` container, trap focus within the panel, and restore focus on close.
   - Provide a heading (`h2`) and ensure Escape/Click outside close behaviours are mirrored via keyboard.

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Expand Keyboard Semantics**:
   - Add `aria-expanded` + keyboard activation (`Enter`/`Space`) support to filter accordions and other toggle controls.
   - Document expected keyboard shortcuts for search suggestions and ensure implementation matches docs.

2. **Document Accessibility for New Surfaces**:
   - Update design system / component docs to reflect requirements for the OCR chip, Search history UX, and shortcuts panel so future contributions uphold standards.

### Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Integrate axe-core (via Vitest, Playwright, or Storybook a11y addon) into the pipeline.
   - Schedule periodic manual audits covering high contrast, reduced motion, and colour-blind simulations.

2. **Advanced Accessibility Features**:
   - Explore persistent user preferences for reduced motion/data.
   - Enhance focus outlines for dark-mode/high-contrast combinations.

## Compliance Check

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Status

| Success Criterion | Status | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content | Partial | Images need alt text, ARIA labels are mostly present |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Partial | Some semantic structure, missing landmarks |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color | Complete | High contrast mode selectable; colour use documented |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | Improved | Sidebar / chip contrast improved; ensure regression tests |
| 1.4.4 Resize text | Unknown | Verify zoom / OS text-size interplay |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | Partial | Core navigation OK; suggestions/shortcuts panel pending |
| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Complete | Skip link implemented |
| 2.4.2 Page Titled | Unknown | Verify document titles per route |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Improved | Modals trap focus; new overlays pending review |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Improved | Landmarks set; dynamic controls need richer state |

## Conclusion

The high-contrast experience, landmark structure, and modal focus handling are now in a much better place; the groundwork from the previous accessibility pass has landed. The remaining gaps centre on newly shipped functionality (search suggestions, shortcuts overlay, OCR chip) and the absence of automated regression tooling. Addressing the high-priority items listed above will keep the project aligned with WCAG expectations and prevent future drift as features evolve.
