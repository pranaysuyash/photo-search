## Recommended Next 5 Tasks

1. **Search History Feature** - This is a fundamental user experience improvement that would immediately benefit users by allowing them to quickly revisit previous searches without retyping. It builds on existing search infrastructure.

2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Users have expressed interest in discovering more keyboard shortcuts. This low-effort feature would significantly improve perceived usability.

3. **Filter Presets** - Power users often apply the same combinations of filters repeatedly. Saving these as presets would dramatically speed up their workflows.

4. **Boolean Search Operators** - Enables more precise searches, which is essential for users with large libraries who need to narrow down results effectively.

5. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Small visual enhancements that improve the perceived quality of the application without major functional changes.
