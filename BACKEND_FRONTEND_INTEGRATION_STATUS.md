# Backend-Frontend Integration Current Status

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Scope**: webapp-v3 ↔ photo-search-intent-first backend  
**Status**: ✅ API Integration Complete

---

## ✅ API Integration Status - RESOLVED

### 1. Library Endpoint - FIXED ✅

**Status**: Previously mismatched → Now correctly implemented

**Frontend Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/services/api.ts - Now correctly uses GET with query parameters
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  dir,
  provider,
  limit: limit.toString(),
  offset: offset.toString(),
});

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/library?${params}`, {
  method: "GET",
});
```

**Backend Compatibility**: ✅ Fully working
- Backend expects GET request with query parameters
- Frontend now properly sends GET with query parameters
- No more POST/Form Data mismatch

### 2. Search Endpoint - FIXED ✅

**Status**: Previously mismatched → Now correctly implemented

**Frontend Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/services/api.ts - Now correctly sends 'query' parameter
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("dir", dir);
formData.append("query", query); // Fixed: Backend expects 'query', not 'q'
formData.append("provider", provider);
formData.append("top_k", topK.toString());
formData.append("offset", offset.toString());
```

**Backend Compatibility**: ✅ Fully working
- Frontend now sends 'query' parameter as expected by backend
- Backend properly receives and processes search requests
- All search functionality operational

### 3. Complete API Feature Support - ✅

All major API endpoints are now properly integrated and functional:

| Feature | Endpoint | Status | Implementation |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Library | `GET /library` | ✅ Working | Full pagination parameters |
| Search | `POST /search` | ✅ Working | Proper FormData with correct field names |
| Analytics | `GET /analytics` | ✅ Working | Full analytics data display |
| Workspaces | `GET /workspace` | ✅ Working | Workspace switching |
| Collections | `GET/POST/DELETE /collections/*` | ✅ Working | Full CRUD operations |
| Faces | `GET/POST /faces/*` | ✅ Working | Face clustering and naming |
| Trips | `GET/POST /trips/*` | ✅ Working | Trip detection and management |
| Photos | `GET /photo` | ✅ Working | Photo serving with fallbacks |
| Thumbnails | `GET /thumb` | ✅ Working | Responsive thumbnail service |

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern - V1 Backend Adapter

### Implementation: ✅ Complete

The project now uses a sophisticated adapter pattern:

1. **V1Adapter** (`api_v1_adapter.ts`): Maps v3 frontend calls to v1 backend endpoints
2. **Environment Toggle**: Switch between native/refactor API and v1 backend via `VITE_API_MODE`
3. **Response Normalization**: Ensures consistent data shapes regardless of backend implementation
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interface contracts

### Adapter Benefits:
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing v1 backend
- ✅ Provides path for future backend refactoring
- ✅ Ensures frontend functionality remains consistent
- ✅ Allows gradual backend improvements without frontend disruption
