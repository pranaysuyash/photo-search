## Python Virtual Environment Information

The photo-search project uses a Python virtual environment located at:
`/Users/pranay/Projects/adhoc_projects/photo-search/photo-search-intent-first/.venv`

To activate the environment:
```bash
cd /Users/pranay/Projects/adhoc_projects/photo-search/photo-search-intent-first
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The virtual environment contains all the necessary dependencies for the photo-search-intent-first project.

## Recent Changes and Additions

### API Versioning Implementation
- Implemented API versioning using URL prefixes (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to ensure backward compatibility
- Created comprehensive router structure under `/api/v1/` with organized sub-routers
- Maintained all existing endpoints for backward compatibility while providing new versioned endpoints
- Added documentation in `API_VERSIONING.md` explaining the versioning strategy

### Response Model Standardization 
- Created base response models in `/api/schemas/v1.py` for consistent API responses:
  - `BaseResponse`: Generic base response model
  - `ErrorResponse`: For error responses
  - `SuccessResponse`: For general success responses
  - `IndexResponse`: For index operation responses
  - `ShareResponse`: For sharing operation responses
  - `FavoriteResponse`: For favorite operation responses
  - `TagResponse`: For tag operation responses
  - `CollectionResponse`: For collection operation responses
  - `HealthResponse`: For health check responses
- Updated multiple endpoints to use proper response models instead of raw dictionaries
- Ensured consistency, validation and better documentation of API responses

### Exception Handling
- Implemented global exception handlers for consistent error responses across all endpoints
- Created custom exception classes for API-specific error scenarios
- Ensured predictable error structures regardless of which endpoint fails
