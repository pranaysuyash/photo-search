# e2e_data

This folder houses small, curated fixtures for end‑to‑end and integration testing:

- People/face clusters (for People view)
- GPS/Map points (for Map view)
- OCR text samples
- Mixed favorites/tags/ratings

Guidelines:
- Keep assets small and license‑clean.
- Prefer PNG/JPG with minimal EXIF where necessary for tests.
- For large‑scale performance testing, generate synthetic paths in temporary directories rather than committing big files.
