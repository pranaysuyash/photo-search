    - Deep link to people/collections detail (ids in URL; open view)

12. **UX & Accessibility** ‚ùå
    - Shortcut overlay (cheat sheet)
    - Focus trapping in modals; improved tab order
    - High-contrast mode; larger text presets

13. **Settings & Config** ‚ùå
    - Preferences export/import (JSON)
    - Theme: dark/light/system (+ persisted)

14. **Packaging** ‚ùå

## New Tasks to Implement (Not Started Yet)

### High Priority - High Impact, Low Complexity
1. **Search History Feature** - Enable users to quickly access recent searches, improving workflow efficiency. Estimated effort: 2-3 days
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Help users discover keyboard shortcuts, enhancing productivity. Estimated effort: 1-2 days
3. **Filter Presets** - Allow users to save and quickly apply common filter combinations. Estimated effort: 2-3 days
4. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Add subtle animations to improve user experience and visual feedback. Estimated effort: 1-2 days

### Medium Priority - Medium Impact/Complexity  
1. **Boolean Search Operators** - Enable advanced search with AND/OR/NOT for more precise results. Estimated effort: 3-5 days
2. **Color-Based Search** - Allow searching by dominant colors in images. Estimated effort: 4-6 days
3. **Bulk Rename Feature** - Enable batch renaming of photos with pattern support. Estimated effort: 3-4 days
4. **Pet Grouping** - Separate pet recognition from people in face detection. Estimated effort: 3-4 days

### Lower Priority - Complex or Niche Features
1. **Reverse Geocoding** - Convert GPS coordinates to place names for better location filtering. Estimated effort: 5-7 days
2. **Denoise/Deblur Presets** - Add image enhancement options for noisy/blurry photos. Estimated effort: 4-6 days
3. **Background Removal** - Integrate Rembg for removing backgrounds from images. Estimated effort: 5-7 days
4. **Electron Packaging** - Create desktop applications for macOS/Windows. Estimated effort: 6-10 days

## Recommended Next 5 Tasks

1. **Search History Feature** - This is a fundamental user experience improvement that would immediately benefit users by allowing them to quickly revisit previous searches without retyping. It builds on existing search infrastructure.

2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Users have expressed interest in discovering more keyboard shortcuts. This low-effort feature would significantly improve perceived usability.

3. **Filter Presets** - Power users often apply the same combinations of filters repeatedly. Saving these as presets would dramatically speed up their workflows.

4. **Boolean Search Operators** - Enables more precise searches, which is essential for users with large libraries who need to narrow down results effectively.

5. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Small visual enhancements that improve the perceived quality of the application without major functional changes.

## Summary Statistics

- **Backend API Coverage**: 47/47 endpoints (100%)
- **Frontend Integration**: ~18/47 endpoints (~38%)
- **Core Features**: 100% complete for MVP
- **Advanced Features**: ~15% complete (7/47 integrated)
- **UI Polish**: ~25% complete
- **User Experience Enhancements**: ~20% complete

The codebase has excellent backend coverage but significant gaps in frontend implementation. The recent completion of the photo editing module represents major progress, filling a critical gap in functionality. The next priority should be completing the remaining high-impact frontend features that leverage the existing backend API.
