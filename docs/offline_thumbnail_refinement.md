# Offline Thumbnail Refinement

## Summary of Work Completed

- Added a smarter thumbnail resolver that prefers cached data, consults `EnhancedOfflineStorage`, and backs off gracefully when offline instead of hammering `/thumb`.
- Updated the virtualized photo grid cells to load thumbnails asynchronously, revoke blob URLs when appropriate, and render a consistent shadcn `Card` fallback when no preview is available.
- Ensured the fallback UI no longer manipulates the DOM with raw HTML and that we avoid `file://` paths for thumbnails by default.

## Files Touched

- `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/services/ThumbnailResolver.ts`
- `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/VirtualizedPhotoGrid.tsx`

## Impact

- Reduces broken thumbnail rendering when users are offline or the backend is unavailable.
- Improves UX consistency by using the shadcn design system for placeholders and states.
- Lays groundwork for future desktop/Electron builds where thumbnails can be resolved via IPC without relying on HTTP.

## Pending Work

- Implement an Electron IPC hook so packaged desktop builds can read thumbnails directly from disk when the Python server is down.
- Integrate a shared thumbnail cache (e.g., via React Query) to avoid redundant resolve calls during virtualization.
- Extend offline-first hooks, queue persistence, conflict handling, and file-watcher invalidation to deliver the full offline-first promise (see broader offline backlog).
- Add automated tests once npm registry access is available again (current sandbox blocks `npx @biomejs/biome`).

## How This Helps

- Users browsing without the Python backend running still see coherent placeholders rather than broken cells.
- Future offline work can rely on a central resolver that already understands cached data and network state.
- The virtualized grid now cleans up object URLs, preventing memory leaks during long sessions.
