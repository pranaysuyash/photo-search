9. **Semantic HTML** - Proper use of semantic elements (buttons, labels, landmarks)
10. **Screen Reader Support** - Announcements and ARIA attributes for assistive technologies

## Issues Identified (Updated Status)

### üî¥ Critical Issues

#### 1. Semantic HTML Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Location**: `SearchBar.tsx:436` (formerly `FaceClusterManager.tsx:243`)
- **Original Issue**: Using `role="option" on div instead of semantic `<option>` element
- **Current Status**: **RESOLVED** - The `role="option"` is now appropriately applied to button elements within a `role="listbox"` container, following proper ARIA design patterns for autocomplete components
- **Fix**: Proper ARIA implementation with listbox/option roles

#### 2. Missing Form Labels (RESOLVED)
- **Location**: Various input fields across modals
- **Current Status**: **RESOLVED** - Extensive use of htmlFor/ID associations found throughout components (AdvancedFilterPanel, FilterPanel, SearchControls, etc.)
- **Fix**: Proper label associations implemented with htmlFor attributes

### üü° Major Issues (REDUCED)

#### 1. Color Contrast (IMPROVED)
- **Location**: Various UI elements
- **Current Status**: **IMPROVED** - High contrast mode available via dedicated CSS file; however, some specific elements may still need evaluation
- **Fix**: High contrast theme implementation, additional automated contrast checking needed

#### 2. Focus Indicators (RESOLVED/MOSTLY)
- **Location**: Interactive elements
- **Current Status**: **MOSTLY RESOLVED** - Extensive use of focus-visible and focus:ring-* classes found in components
- **Fix**: Consistent focus indicator patterns using Tailwind CSS

#### 3. Image Alt Text (PENDING)
- **Location**: Photo grid components
- **Current Status**: **PENDING** - Dynamic images may still lack descriptive alt text
- **Fix**: Generate meaningful alt text for all images

### üü¢ Minor Issues (REDUCED)

#### 1. Landmark Regions (IMPROVED)
- **Location**: Page structure
- **Current Status**: **IMPROVED** - Use of semantic HTML and ARIA landmarks increased since initial audit
- **Fix**: Continued implementation of appropriate landmark roles

#### 2. Heading Hierarchy (IMPROVED)
- **Location**: Various components
- **Current Status**: **IMPROVED** - Better adherence to logical heading structure observed
- **Fix**: Continued monitoring for consistent heading hierarchy

## Keyboard Navigation Assessment

### Working Features

### Needs Improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus management on route changes (improved but could be enhanced)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keyboard traps in some complex components (minimized)

## Screen Reader Testing

### Tested With
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)

### Results (Updated)
- ‚úÖ Basic navigation works
- ‚úÖ Dynamic content announcements functional
- ‚úÖ ARIA descriptions properly implemented in many components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some components may still lack proper ARIA descriptions in edge cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Form validation messages improved but could be enhanced

## Color Contrast Analysis (Updated)

### Current Status
The application now includes:
- High contrast CSS theme file (`high-contrast.css`)
- Tailwind-based focus states with proper contrast ratios
- Automated contrast checking tools now implemented (Biome linter)

### Previously Reported Combinations (Status Update)
| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Status | Current Status |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Body text | #374151 | #FFFFFF | 7.5:1 | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚úÖ Still compliant |
| Link text | #2563EB | #FFFFFF | 4.8:1 | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚úÖ Still compliant |
| Button text | #FFFFFF | #3B82F6 | 3.1:1 | ‚ùå Fail | üîÅ Improved with high-contrast mode |
| Disabled text | #9CA3AF | #F3F4F6 | 2.8:1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è N/A | üîÅ Improved with high-contrast mode |

## Recommendations (Updated)

## Conclusion

The Photo Search application has made significant progress in accessibility since the original audit. Many of the critical and major issues identified have been resolved through systematic implementation of accessibility features. The application now includes:

- Comprehensive accessibility utilities and components
- High contrast mode support
- Proper ARIA implementation
- Consistent focus management
- Improved semantic HTML structure

While the application has made great strides toward WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, continued efforts are needed for full compliance, particularly in image alt text and user testing with assistive technology users. The overall accessibility foundation is now much stronger than at the time of the original audit.

## Historical Context (Preserved for Reference)

The original audit identified several critical issues that have since been systematically addressed through targeted development efforts. This demonstrates the project's commitment to improving accessibility. The following issues were particularly important to address:

- The semantic HTML issues that prevented proper screen reader operation
- The lack of form labels that made navigation difficult for keyboard users  
- The focus management problems that created inconsistent user experiences

These improvements have been implemented in a systematic way that maintains the application's functionality while significantly enhancing its accessibility.
