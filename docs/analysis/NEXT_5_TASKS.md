# Recommended Next 5 Tasks

1. **Search History Feature** - Why this should be first: This is a fundamental user experience improvement that would immediately benefit users by allowing them to quickly revisit previous searches without retyping. It builds on existing search infrastructure and has high user impact with relatively low complexity.

2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Why this should be second: Users have expressed interest in discovering more keyboard shortcuts. This low-effort feature would significantly improve perceived usability and help users become more proficient with the application.

3. **Filter Presets** - Why this should be third: Power users often apply the same combinations of filters repeatedly. Saving these as presets would dramatically speed up their workflows and improve efficiency for frequent users.

4. **Boolean Search Operators** - Why this should be fourth: Enables more precise searches, which is essential for users with large libraries who need to narrow down results effectively. This moves beyond basic search to more advanced querying capabilities.

5. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Why this should be fifth: Small visual enhancements that improve the perceived quality of the application without major functional changes. These subtle improvements contribute to a more polished user experience.
