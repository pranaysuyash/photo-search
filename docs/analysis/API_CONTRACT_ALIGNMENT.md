# API/Client Contract Alignment – JSON Body for POST Endpoints

Intent: I need a working development and deployment pipeline. The client (webapp) sends JSON request bodies for POST endpoints; the API must accept JSON while preserving existing query param compatibility.

## Current Status (Updated)

### ✅ COMPLETED – JSON Body Support Implemented

#### Endpoints with JSON Body Support (using Pydantic models):
- /index (now uses IndexRequest model)
- /search (now uses SearchRequest model)
- /search_workspace (now uses WorkspaceSearchRequest model)
- /captions/build
- /faces/build
- /faces/name
- /trips/build
- **/search_like** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/search_like_plus** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/ocr/build** (now uses proper body parsing with _from_body utility)
- **/ocr/snippets** (now standardized)
- **/fast/build** (now uses proper body parsing with _from_body utility)
- **/favorites (POST)** (now uses FavoritesRequest model)
- **/tags (POST)** (now uses TagsRequest model)
- **/saved (POST)** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/saved/delete** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/collections** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/collections/delete** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/smart_collections** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/smart_collections/delete** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/smart_collections/resolve** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/feedback** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/analytics/log** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/lookalikes/resolve** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/open** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/edit/ops** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/edit/upscale** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/export** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/share** (now uses ShareRequest model)
- **/share/revoke** (now uses ShareRevokeRequest model)
- **/workspace/add** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/workspace/remove** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/metadata/build** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/autotag** (now uses proper body parsing with _from_body utility)
- **/delete** (now standardized with proper models)
- **/undo_delete** (now standardized with proper models)

#### API Standardization Achievements:
- **All POST endpoints** now accept JSON body parameters with proper Pydantic validation
- **Backward compatibility** maintained through query parameter fallback
- **Standardized request models** using Pydantic schemas (IndexRequest, SearchRequest, etc.)
- **Standardized response models** using Pydantic schemas (SuccessResponse, IndexResponse, etc.)
- **API versioning** implemented with `/api/v1/` prefix for standardized endpoints

## Implementation Approach (Completed)
- ✅ Used Pydantic request models for validation and standardization
- ✅ For legacy endpoints: Added optional `body: dict | None = Body(None)` to POST handlers
- ✅ Coalesced values from `body` when query args are missing using `_from_body` helper
- ✅ Maintained response schemas consistency with new BaseResponse/SuccessResponse patterns
- ✅ Preserved backward compatibility with existing query-style callers

## Acceptance Criteria (All Met)
- ✅ All POST endpoints used in `webapp/src/api.ts` accept JSON bodies without 422 errors.
- ✅ GET endpoints remain unchanged (as intended).
- ✅ Existing query-style POST requests still work (backward compatibility maintained).
- ✅ Tests cover all major endpoints: /search_like, /ocr/build, /export, /share, /favorites, /tags.

## Test Plan (Implemented)
- ✅ Unit/Integration tests using FastAPI TestClient
- ✅ JSON body and query param fallback testing implemented
- ✅ End-to-end validation across all endpoint categories
- ✅ Webapp integration testing completed

## Implementation Timeline
- **Original Estimate:** ~2–4 hours for code + tests
- **Actual Implementation:** Significantly more comprehensive, completed as part of broader API standardization effort
- **Risk Level:** Low to zero - pure additive changes with full backward compatibility

## Intent Philosophy Alignment
This implementation aligns with the intent philosophy by:
- **User-focused:** Prioritizing the smooth client experience over technical convenience
- **Progressive enhancement:** Maintaining existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- **Consistency:** Establishing standardized contracts that improve maintainability
- **Backward compatibility:** Respecting existing integrations while enabling future improvements

## Rollout (Completed)
- ✅ All endpoints updated in structured manner
- ✅ API tests passing for all endpoint categories
- ✅ E2E navigation and job flows validated
- ✅ Client integration verified across all functionality areas

## Historical Context (Preserved for Reference)

The original API contract alignment plan identified a critical need to support both JSON body and query parameter requests for backward compatibility. The implementation has gone beyond the original scope by implementing comprehensive API standardization with:

1. **Pydantic request/response models** for all endpoints
2. **Proper API versioning** with `/api/v1/` endpoints
3. **Consistent response patterns** across all endpoints
4. **Maintained backward compatibility** while modernizing the API structure

This approach demonstrates the project's commitment to maintaining a clean, consistent API contract while respecting existing integrations and enabling future growth.
