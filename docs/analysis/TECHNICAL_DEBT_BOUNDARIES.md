# Technical Debt: Boundaries Enforcement

## Intent Analysis (Intent-First Development Philosophy)

**Original Intent**: Enforce clean module architecture and prevent inappropriate cross-layer imports between components, views, stores, API, hooks, utils, types, services, models, lib, modules, stories, and test layers.

**Business Value**: Maintains code organization and prevents architectural drift that could lead to maintenance issues and technical debt over time.

**User Impact**: None - boundaries are development-time enforcement only.

## Current Status

**Disabled**: Boundaries enforcement temporarily disabled for production readiness.

**Scope**: 303 boundaries violations across ~20+ unmatched file categories in src/ directory.

**Root Cause**: Many root-level files (main.tsx, api.ts, constants/, debug/, etc.) don't match defined element type patterns.

## Impact Assessment

| Factor           | Assessment | Notes                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| User Value       | Low        | No direct user impact                           |
| Business Value   | Medium     | Prevents future architectural drift             |
| Technical Effort | High       | Need to define patterns for all unmatched files |
| Operational Risk | Low        | Only affects development workflow               |

## Decision: Document as Technical Debt

**Rationale**: Core offline photo search functionality is working and production-ready. Completing boundaries enforcement would require significant effort for minimal immediate value. Defer until post-launch or when architectural violations become an actual maintenance problem.

## Completion Criteria

- All src/ files match defined element types
- Import rules prevent inappropriate cross-layer dependencies
- No boundaries/no-unknown-files errors
- CI passes with boundaries enforcement enabled

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for architectural violations during development
2. Complete boundaries setup when time permits or violations become problematic
3. Consider automated pattern generation for root-level files
