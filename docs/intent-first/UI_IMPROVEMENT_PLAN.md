# Photo Search UI Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the prioritized improvements for the Photo Search applications (both intent-first modern UI and classic UI). The plan focuses on enhancing user experience, code maintainability, and feature completeness while maintaining the core principles of privacy-first, local-first photo management.

## Current State Analysis

### Intent-First App (Modern UI)

- **Strengths**: Rich feature set, modern React architecture, good accessibility foundations, dark mode, keyboard shortcuts
- **Weaknesses**: Complex codebase (1000+ lines in App.tsx), incomplete features, basic progress UI, no undo for destructive actions

### Classic App

- **Strengths**: Simple, straightforward interface
- **Weaknesses**: Less polished, fewer features, older UI patterns

## Prioritized Improvement Roadmap

### ðŸš¨ Phase 1: Foundation & Critical Fixes (1-2 weeks)

#### 1. API Contract Alignment

**Priority**: Critical
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: POST endpoints currently use query parameters instead of JSON request bodies, leading to unreliable client-server communication.

**Solution**:

- Convert all POST endpoints to use JSON bodies
- Update client-side API calls in `webapp/src/api.ts`
- Affected endpoints: `/search`, `/search_like`, `/favorites`, `/tags`, `/saved`, `/collections`, etc.

**Code Changes**:

```typescript
// Before
const response = await fetch(`/api/search?dir=${dir}&query=${query}`)

// After
const response = await fetch('/api/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ dir, query, filters: {...} })
})
```

#### 2. Safe Delete with Undo

**Priority**: Critical
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: No OS trash integration, no undo functionality for destructive actions.

**Solution**:

- Implement OS trash integration using `send2trash` library
- Add 10-second undo toast for delete operations
- Update delete modal with confirmation and undo option

**Features to Add**:

- `apiDelete()` function with `toTrash` parameter
- Undo functionality with toast notifications
- Safe delete confirmation modal

#### 3. Enhanced Progress UI for Long Operations

**Priority**: Critical
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: Basic "busy" indicator doesn't provide enough feedback for long-running operations.

**Solution**:

- Replace simple busy state with indeterminate progress bar
- Add detailed status messages during indexing, OCR, metadata build
- Make operations cancelable where possible

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const [progress, setProgress] = useState({
  indeterminate: true,
  message: "",
  details: "",
  cancelable: false,
});
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements (1 week)

#### 4. Timeline View Enhancement

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: Current timeline view is basic day grouping without advanced navigation.

**Solution**:

- Add mini-scrubber for quick date navigation
- Implement auto-clustering by date ranges
- Add smooth scrolling and lazy loading

**Features**:

- Month/year sticky headers
- Date range clustering
- Quick navigation scrubber
- Infinite scroll with lazy loading

#### 5. Move to Collection Feature

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

**Problem**: No way to move photos between collections efficiently.

**Solution**:

- Add "Move to Collection" modal for selected photos
- Support creating new collections on-the-fly
- Handle idempotent operations and provide feedback

**UI Components**:

- Collection selection dropdown
- "Create new collection" option
- Bulk move confirmation
- Success/error feedback

#### 6. Improved Empty States

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

**Problem**: Empty states are not engaging or helpful.

**Solution**:

- Enhance no-results, no-directory, no-photos states
- Add sample search suggestions
- Include quick actions (demo photos, help)

**States to Improve**:

- No directory selected
- No photos in directory
- No search results
- No favorites
- No collections

### ðŸ”§ Phase 3: Architecture & Performance (1-2 weeks)

#### 7. Component Architecture Refactor

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Problem**: App.tsx is too large (1000+ lines) and complex.

**Solution**:

- Extract large components into separate files
- Create reusable component library
- Improve code maintainability

**Components to Extract**:

- `SearchView.tsx`
- `LibraryView.tsx`
- `PeopleView.tsx`
- `ModalManager.tsx`
- `KeyboardShortcutHandler` hook

#### 8. Enhanced Accessibility

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: Some accessibility features are missing or incomplete.

**Solution**:

- Add skip links for screen readers
- Improve focus management in modals and lightbox
- Add proper ARIA live regions for status updates
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper labels

**Accessibility Improvements**:

- Skip navigation links
- ARIA live regions for status updates

#### 9. Progressive Image Loading

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium

**Problem**: All images load at full resolution immediately.

**Solution**:

- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement intelligent caching with size limits

**Implementation**:

- Multiple thumbnail sizes (64px, 256px, 1024px)
- Progressive loading with blur-to-sharp transition
- Cache management with LRU eviction
- Error handling with fallback images

#### 10. Filter Presets & Smart Filters

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

**Solution**:

- Save/load filter combinations as presets
- Add advanced filters (aspect ratio, orientation, dominant color)
- Implement negative filters (exclude tags/people)

**New Filter Types**:

- Aspect ratio ranges
- Orientation (portrait/landscape/square)
