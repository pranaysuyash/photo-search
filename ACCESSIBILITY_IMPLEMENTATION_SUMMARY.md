# Accessibility Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the accessibility improvements implemented following the intent handbook.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed High Contrast Mode
**Issue**: The `high-contrast.css` file existed but was never imported into the application.
**Solution**: Added import statement to `main.tsx`:
```typescript
import "./high-contrast.css";
```
**Impact**: The high contrast mode is now fully functional when enabled through the settings.

### 2. Implemented Color Contrast Improvements in Sidebar
**Issue**: The documented color contrast improvements in `Sidebar.tsx` were not implemented.
**Solution**: Updated `styles-modern.css` to improve text contrast:
- Changed `.nav-section-title` color from `var(--text-secondary)` to `var(--text-tertiary)`
- Changed `.nav-item-count` color from `var(--text-secondary)` to `var(--text-tertiary)`
**Impact**: Better color contrast ratios for section headers and item counts in the sidebar.

### 3. Added ARIA States and Landmarks
**Issue**: Missing ARIA states and landmark navigation for screen readers.
**Solution**: 
- Added `role="main"` and `aria-label="Main content"` to the main content area in `App.tsx`
- Added `id="main-content"` for skip-to-content linking
- Added `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the sidebar nav in `Sidebar.tsx`
- Added `aria-current="page"` to active navigation items in `Sidebar.tsx`
- Added `aria-label` attributes to navigation items with count information

### 4. Completed Keyboard Navigation with Focus Management
**Issue**: Incomplete keyboard navigation and focus management.
**Solution**:
- Implemented focus trapping in modal dialogs (`FolderModal.tsx` and `AccessibilityPanel.tsx`)
- Added auto-focus to first focusable elements in modals
- Implemented proper Escape key handling for modal closing
- Added keyboard event listeners for focus management

### 5. Added Skip-to-Content Link
**Issue**: Missing skip-to-content link for keyboard users.
**Solution**: 
- Added skip-to-content link at the top of `App.tsx`:
```jsx
<a
  href="#main-content"
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md"
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
```
- Added corresponding `id="main-content"` to the main content area

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify all interactive elements are reachable via Tab key
3. **Color Contrast Verification**: Use tools like axe-core or WAVE to verify contrast ratios
4. **Focus Management**: Ensure focus is properly trapped in modals and moves logically
5. **High Contrast Mode**: Test the high contrast theme with various color combinations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Automated Accessibility Testing**: Integrate axe-core into the testing pipeline
2. **Enhance ARIA Live Regions**: Add more dynamic content announcements
3. **Improve Reduced Motion Support**: Add more comprehensive motion reduction options
4. **Add Language Attributes**: Add proper lang attributes to the HTML element
5. **Enhance Form Labels**: Add more descriptive labels and error messaging
