# Fix role="status" to <output> in App.tsx - but since changing tags might break React, let's skip these for now

# Fix FaceClusterManager.tsx role="option" 
# These need to be checked individually as they might be part of select/listbox components

# Fix Collections.tsx role="listitem" to <li>
# These also need careful review as they need to be inside <ul> or <ol>
