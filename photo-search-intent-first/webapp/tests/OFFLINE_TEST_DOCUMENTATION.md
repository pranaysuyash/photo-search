### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### Test Execution

#### Basic Offline Tests
```bash
# Run basic offline tests
npm run test:offline

# Run offline tests in CI mode
npm run test:offline:ci

# Run offline tests with debug mode
npm run test:offline:debug
```

#### Mobile Offline Tests
```bash
# Run mobile-specific offline tests
npm run test:offline:mobile
```

#### Performance Tests
```bash
# Run performance-focused offline tests
npm run test:offline:performance
```

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Run all offline tests with the comprehensive script
./test-offline-comprehensive.sh

# Run specific test categories
./test-offline-comprehensive.sh --skip-performance
./test-offline-comprehensive.sh --skip-mobile
./test-offline-comprehensive.sh --ui
```

### Test Configuration

The test suite can be configured using command-line flags:

- `--skip-basic` - Skip basic offline tests
- `--skip-mobile` - Skip mobile offline tests
- `--skip-performance` - Skip performance tests
- `--ui` - Run tests with Playwright UI
- `--help` - Show help message

### Environment Variables

- `PLAYWRIGHT_VERBOSE=1` - Enable verbose logging
- `CI=1` - Run in CI mode (more retries, different reporting)
- `DEBUG=pw:api` - Enable Playwright API debugging

## Test Scenarios

### Network Simulation

The test suite includes various network simulation scenarios:

1. **Complete Offline** - Simulates full network disconnection
2. **Flaky Network** - Simulates intermittent network failures
3. **Slow Network** - Simulates high-latency connections
4. **Mobile Network** - Simulates mobile-specific network conditions

### Test Data Generation

The test suite includes utilities for generating test data:

- **Collections**: Generate test photo collections
- **Photos**: Generate test photo metadata
- **Actions**: Generate offline action queue items
- **Network Events**: Simulate connectivity events

## Performance Metrics

The test suite collects and validates various performance metrics:

### Page Load Time
- Measures time to load app shell offline
- Validates acceptable performance thresholds
- Tests cached vs non-cached performance

### Memory Usage
- Monitors memory consumption during offline operations
- Tests memory efficiency of action queuing
- Validates garbage collection behavior

### Network Requests
- Tracks network request patterns
- Validates caching effectiveness
- Tests offline request handling

### Sync Performance
- Measures time to sync queued actions
- Validates batch processing efficiency
- Tests large queue handling

## Expected Behavior

### Offline Detection
- Application should detect network disconnection within 2 seconds
- No dedicated offline indicator is displayed (offline-first experience)
- User flows continue seamlessly with local models and cached data

### Action Queuing
- User actions should be queued when offline
- Queue should persist across browser sessions
- User should receive feedback about queued actions

### Sync Operation
- Sync should start automatically when connection is restored
- Progress should be clearly communicated to user
- Failed syncs should be retried with exponential backoff

### Data Integrity
- No data should be lost during connectivity changes
- User preferences should be preserved
- Queued actions should maintain order and完整性

### Error Handling
- Application should not crash during network issues
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Recovery should be automatic and seamless
