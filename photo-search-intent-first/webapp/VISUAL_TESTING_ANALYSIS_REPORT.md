   - Tablet: Expected 6627px vs Current 1024px
   - Mobile: Expected 17941px vs Current 667px
   - **Impact**: All visual tests failing due to layout changes

2. **Browser Installation Issues**:
   - Some browsers (Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Safari) required manual installation
   - Chromium working correctly for testing

3. **Test Stability**:
   - Dynamic content masking could be improved
   - Animation disabling needs refinement

## Technical Assessment

### Code Quality
```typescript
// Example of well-structured test
test.describe("Visual: Responsive Design", () => {
  test("desktop layout renders correctly", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");
    await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
    await page.waitForSelector("#root", { state: "visible", timeout: 30000 });

    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("desktop-layout.png", {
      fullPage: true,
      maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.02,
    });
  });
});
```

**Strengths**:
- Proper async/await usage
- Good error handling with timeouts
- Appropriate screenshot configuration
- Cross-browser compatible

### Configuration Quality
- **Parallel execution**: Optimized for speed
- **Timeout handling**: Appropriate for complex applications
- **Screenshot settings**: Balanced between accuracy and flexibility
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive with artifacts preservation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Update Screenshot Baselines**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --update-snapshots
   ```
   - Update all failing snapshots to current application state
   - Review changes for any unexpected visual regressions

2. **Browser Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```
   - Ensure all browsers are properly installed
   - Verify cross-browser compatibility

### Medium-term Improvements (Priority 2)

3. **Enhance Test Stability**
   - Improve dynamic content masking
   - Add better wait conditions for complex components
   - Implement retry logic for flaky interactions

4. **Expand Coverage**
   - Add more user journey tests
   - Include edge case scenarios
   - Test error states and recovery paths

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)

5. **Performance Testing Integration**
   - Add performance benchmarks to visual tests
   - Monitor performance regressions alongside visual changes

6. **Accessibility Testing Expansion**
   - Deeper accessibility analysis integration
   - WCAG compliance validation
   - Screen reader testing

7. **Mobile App Testing**
   - Expand mobile-specific test coverage
   - Add device-specific testing scenarios
   - PWA feature validation
