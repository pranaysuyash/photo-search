# Frontend V3 Implementation Plan

**Owner**: Frontend Lead  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

## Executive Summary

Taking full ownership of Frontend V3 to bring it to world-class production quality with proper polish, complete backend integration, and enterprise-grade UX.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

- React + Vite dev environment running smoothly
- Basic routing structure in place
- Shadcn/ui components integrated
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Dark mode support

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Found

#### 1. API Integration Gaps

- **Status**: Partially Fixed
- Search endpoint: Uses correct POST with JSON body ✅
- Library endpoint: Uses correct GET with query params ✅
- **Remaining**: Need to verify all other endpoints match backend expectations

#### 2. Missing Features from Backend

Backend has 20+ routers that aren't integrated:

- Collections management
- Tags/Favorites system
- Face recognition
- Video support
- Smart collections
- Trips/timeline
- OCR text search
- Batch operations
- Sharing features
- Advanced diagnostics

#### 3. Design Polish Needed

- Landing page lacks visual hierarchy
- Search experience needs refinement
- Loading states inconsistent
- Error handling UI missing
- Empty states not polished
- Transitions/animations minimal

#### 4. Architecture Concerns

- State management strategy unclear (Context vs Zustand?)
- No proper error boundary implementation
- Missing service worker for offline
- No telemetry/analytics integration
- Testing infrastructure incomplete

## Design Principles

### Visual Design

1. **Consistency**: Use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
2. **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy guides user attention
3. **Whitespace**: Generous spacing prevents cluttered feeling
4. **Motion**: Subtle, purposeful animations enhance UX
5. **Feedback**: Every action gets immediate visual response

### UX Patterns

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed
2. **Forgiving**: Easy undo, clear confirmation for destructive actions
3. **Responsive**: Adapt layout intelligently to screen size
4. **Fast**: Perceived performance through optimistic updates
5. **Accessible**: Usable by everyone, regardless of abilities

### Copy Principles

1. **Clear**: Use plain language, avoid jargon
2. **Concise**: Respect user's time and attention
3. **Helpful**: Guide users to success
4. **Human**: Warm, friendly tone
5. **Consistent**: Same terminology throughout

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier configured and enforced
- No console.log in production
- Proper error handling everywhere
- Comments for complex logic only

### Component Guidelines

- Functional components with hooks
- Props interface clearly defined
- Maximum 250 lines per component
- Extract custom hooks for complex logic
- Use composition over inheritance

### State Management

- Zustand for global state (following webapp pattern)
- React Query for server state
- Context for theme/i18n only
- Local state for component-specific UI

### Testing Requirements

- 80% code coverage minimum
- All custom hooks tested
- Critical user flows have E2E tests
- Visual regression for key screens
- Accessibility tests automated

## Success Metrics

### Technical

- [ ] Lighthouse Performance > 90
- [ ] Lighthouse Accessibility > 95
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB gzipped

### User Experience

- [ ] Can complete photo search in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Can build library index in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Zero errors in normal usage scenarios
- [ ] Mobile-friendly on all devices
- [ ] Works offline after first visit

### Business

- [ ] Feature parity with backend (100%)
- [ ] Zero P0 bugs
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Production deployment ready
- [ ] Monitoring/telemetry integrated

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Backend has 20+ routers, easy to get lost
   - _Mitigation_: Prioritize core features, document nice-to-haves
2. **Design Time**: Polishing UX can be endless
   - _Mitigation_: Set time boxes, use proven design patterns
3. **Testing Gaps**: Not enough time for comprehensive testing

   - _Mitigation_: Focus on critical paths, automate what we can

4. **Backend Changes**: API might evolve during development
   - _Mitigation_: Version API responses, maintain backward compatibility

## Decision Log

### Architecture Decisions

#### ADR-001: State Management - Zustand

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Context**: Need consistent state management across V3  
**Decision**: Use Zustand (same as webapp) for familiarity and simplicity  
**Consequences**: Team already knows it, less learning curve, smaller bundle size than Redux

#### ADR-002: Component Library - Shadcn/ui

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Already integrated, modern, accessible  
**Decision**: Continue with Shadcn/ui, add custom components as needed  
**Consequences**: Copy-paste model means we own the code, can customize freely

#### ADR-003: API Layer - Centralized Service

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need single source of truth for API calls  
**Decision**: Keep api.ts as central service, add React Query for caching  
**Consequences**: Clear separation, easy to mock for testing, automatic caching/refetching

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ Start dev servers
2. 🔄 Complete API integration audit
3. 🔄 Fix remaining endpoint issues
4. ⏳ Implement basic error handling
5. ⏳ Add loading states to all async operations

### This Week

1. Implement state management with Zustand
2. Build out Collections UI
3. Add Tags/Favorites management
4. Polish landing page design
5. Improve search experience

### Questions for Product/Stakeholder

1. **Priority Order**: Which features are must-have vs nice-to-have?
2. **Design Language**: Are there brand guidelines to follow?
3. **Target Audience**: B2C, B2B, or both? Affects UX decisions
4. **Performance Targets**: What's acceptable for photo indexing time?
5. **Browser Support**: Do we need IE11? (Hope not!)
