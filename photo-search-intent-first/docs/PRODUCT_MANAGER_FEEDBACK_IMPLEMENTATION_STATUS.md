# Product Manager Feedback Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of product manager feedback from test users regarding the photo search application's query understanding limitations and improvement areas.

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Query Understanding Limitations - RESOLVED
**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Files**:
- `/webapp/src/utils/advancedQueryParser.ts` - Main parser implementation
- `/webapp/src/utils/__tests__/advancedQueryParser.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (40 tests)

**Implementation Details**:
- **Boolean Logic Support**: Full AND/OR/NOT operators with multiple variations (`and`, `or`, `not`, `&`, `|`, `+`, `-`)
- **Complex Expressions**: Proper operator precedence using Shunting Yard algorithm
- **Parenthetical Grouping**: Support for nested expressions like `(dogs OR cats) AND outdoor`
- **Context-Aware Search**:
  - Time context: `day`, `night`, `sunset`, `golden hour`, `dawn`, `dusk`
  - Season context: `spring`, `summer`, `fall`, `winter`
  - Location context: `indoor`, `outdoor`, `urban`, `nature`, `water`
  - Activity context: `portrait`, `landscape`, `action`, `still_life`, `event`
  - Quality context: `professional`, `casual`, `snapshot`, `artistic`
  - Mood context: `happy`, `sad`, `peaceful`, `energetic`, `dramatic`
- **Query Expansion & Synonyms**: Smart synonym expansion (`dog` â†’ `puppy`, `canine`, `pet`)
- **Exclusion & Negation**: Multiple exclusion operators (`NOT`, `without`, `excluding`, `-`)
- **Test Coverage**: 40 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality

**User Impact**: Users can now express complex search intentions like `"beach sunset NOT night with professional quality"` and get accurate results.
