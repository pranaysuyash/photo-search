# Analysis: Internet-Dependent vs Offline Model Capabilities

## Question: Why do 14 endpoints require internet when we have offline models?

### Current Implementation Analysis

Let me examine what's actually implemented vs. what the API parity suggests:

```bash
# Check what AI/ML capabilities are currently available locally
find . -name "*.py" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" -exec grep -l "model\|ai\|ml\|embedding\|clip\|face\|ocr" {} \;
```

### Key Finding: The API Parity Diff May Be Misleading

The `api_parity_diff.json` file appears to be comparing against a different version of the API that may have been designed for cloud-based deployment. However, the current implementation seems to be offline-first.

Let me check what's actually in the current model implementation:
