## Integration Guide

### 1. Basic Integration

```typescript
import EnhancedMultiFolderSearch from './components/EnhancedMultiFolderSearch';

function SearchPage() {
  const workspace = ["/path/to/folder1", "/path/to/folder2"];

  const handleSearch = (query: string, scope: SearchScope) => {
    console.log("Searching:", query, "in scope:", scope);
    // Perform search with selected folders
  };

  return (
    <EnhancedMultiFolderSearch
      workspace={workspace}
      onSearch={handleSearch}
      currentQuery="initial query"
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Integration with Existing SearchBar

```typescript
import MultiFolderSearchToggle from './components/MultiFolderSearchToggle';

function EnhancedSearchPage() {
  const [showMultiFolder, setShowMultiFolder] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="search-container">
      {/* Regular SearchBar */}
      <SearchBar
        searchText={searchQuery}
        setSearchText={setSearchQuery}
        onSearch={handleSimpleSearch}
      />

      {/* Multi-Folder Toggle */}
      <MultiFolderSearchToggle
        workspace={workspace}
        onSearch={handleMultiFolderSearch}
        currentQuery={searchQuery}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Results Integration

```typescript
import MultiFolderSearchResults from './components/MultiFolderSearchResults';

function SearchResultsPage() {
  return (
    <MultiFolderSearchResults
      results={searchResults}
      searchQuery={currentQuery}
      searchScope={currentSearchScope}
      onResultClick={(result) => {
        // Handle result selection (e.g., open lightbox)
        openLightbox(result.path);
      }}
      onFolderFilter={(folderPath) => {
        // Filter results by specific folder
        filterByFolder(folderPath);

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Component Architecture

```
EnhancedMultiFolderSearch (main component)
├── EnhancedMultiFolderSearch (core search interface)
│   ├── Tabs (Simple/Advanced/Templates)
│   ├── Scope selection (All/Recent/Custom)
│   ├── Folder picker with search
│   ├── Search templates
│   └── Help system
├── MultiFolderSearchToggle (integration wrapper)
└── MultiFolderSearchResults (results display)
    ├── All results view
    ├── By folder grouping
    └── Top results view
```

### 2. State Management

**Search Scope State:**
```typescript
interface SearchScope {
  type: "all" | "selected" | "custom";
  selectedFolders: string[];
  searchScope: "all" | "recent" | "favorites";
}
```

**Folder Information:**
```typescript
interface FolderInfo {
  path: string;
  name: string;
  photoCount?: number;
  lastModified?: string;
  isFavorite?: boolean;
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Folder details loaded on demand
- **Debounced Search**: Folder search with 300ms debounce
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large folder lists (future enhancement)
- **Memoized Calculations**: Folder statistics cached

## Usage Examples

### 1. Simple Multi-Folder Search

```typescript
// User wants to find beach photos across all folders
const searchScope = {
  type: "all",
  selectedFolders: [],
  searchScope: "all"
};

handleSearch("beach sunset", searchScope);
// Results: All beach sunset photos from all folders
```

### 2. Custom Folder Selection

```typescript
// User wants to search only specific folders
const searchScope = {
  type: "custom",
  selectedFolders: [
    "/Users/john/Pictures/Vacation",
    "/Users/john/Pictures/Travel"
  ],
  searchScope: "all"
};

handleSearch("family", searchScope);
// Results: Family photos only from Vacation and Travel folders
```

### 3. Template-Based Search

```typescript
// User clicks "Recent Travel Photos" template
const template = {
  name: "Recent Travel Photos",
  query: "vacation OR travel OR trip",
  scopes: ["selected", "custom"]
};

// Automatically applies:
handleSearch("vacation OR travel OR trip", {
  type: "selected",
  selectedFolders: [],
  searchScope: "recent"
});
```

## Migration Guide

### From Existing MultiFolderSearchControls

**Old Component:**
```typescript
<MultiFolderSearchControls
  workspace={workspace}
  searchScope={searchScope}
  onScopeChange={setSearchScope}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
/>
```

**New Enhanced Component:**
```typescript
<EnhancedMultiFolderSearch
  workspace={workspace}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
  currentQuery={searchQuery}
/>
```

**Key Differences:**
1. **Simplified Props**: Fewer required props, better defaults
2. **Integrated Help**: Built-in help system and templates
3. **Better UX**: Tabbed interface with progressive disclosure
4. **Enhanced Results**: Better results display and attribution

### Integration with Existing Search Flow

**Step 1: Add Import**
```typescript
import EnhancedMultiFolderSearch from './components/EnhancedMultiFolderSearch';
```

**Step 2: Update Search Handler**
```typescript
const handleMultiFolderSearch = (query: string, scope: SearchScope) => {
  // Use enhanced search scope with existing search logic
  performSearch(query, { ...searchParams, folders: scope.selectedFolders });
};
```

**Step 3: Add to UI**
```typescript
// Add as tab or toggle in existing search interface
<Tabs value={activeTab}>
  <TabsTrigger value="simple">Simple Search</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="multi-folder">Multi-Folder</TabsTrigger>
</Tabs>

<TabsContent value="multi-folder">
  <EnhancedMultiFolderSearch
    workspace={workspace}
    onSearch={handleMultiFolderSearch}
  />
</TabsContent>
```
