# Enhanced Offline-First Capabilities User Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the enhanced offline-first capabilities of the Photo Search application, which allow you to continue using core functionality even without internet connectivity, with automatic synchronization when connectivity returns.

## Key Features

### 1. True Offline Operation
The Photo Search application now works completely offline with local AI models:
- **Semantic Search**: Search photos by describing what's in them using CLIP embeddings
- **OCR Text Search**: Find photos containing specific text using optical character recognition
- **Face Recognition**: Automatically detect and group faces in your photos
- **Caption Generation**: AI-generated captions for better searchability

### 2. Enhanced Caching System
The application uses an intelligent caching system that:
- Stores search results locally for instant retrieval
- Caches photo metadata and embeddings for fast browsing
- Maintains favorites, tags, and collections offline
- Automatically synchronizes changes when online

### 3. Automatic Sync
When connectivity is restored:
- Queued actions (favorites, tags, etc.) are automatically synchronized
- Search indices are updated with new photos
- Metadata changes are reconciled with the server
- Conflicts are resolved with intelligent merging

## How It Works

### Offline Detection
The application automatically detects when you're offline and seamlessly switches to offline mode:
- Monitors network connectivity status
- Falls back to cached data when API is unreachable
- Continues to queue actions for later synchronization

### Data Storage
All your data is stored securely on your device:
- **Photos**: Original photos remain in their current locations
- **Metadata**: Photo metadata, tags, and favorites stored in local SQLite database
- **Embeddings**: AI-generated embeddings cached locally for semantic search
- **Search Indices**: Precomputed search indices for fast offline search

### Conflict Resolution
When synchronizing changes:
- Last-write-wins strategy for most operations
- Manual conflict resolution for complex cases
- Automatic merging of non-conflicting changes

## Using Offline Features

### Browsing Photos Offline
1. **Select Folder**: Choose your photo directory (remains available offline)
2. **View Library**: Browse all photos instantly without internet
3. **View Metadata**: Access photo details, EXIF data, and tags
4. **View Favorites**: See your favorite photos and collections

### Searching Photos Offline
1. **Semantic Search**: Enter natural language queries like "sunset at beach"
2. **OCR Search**: Search for photos containing specific text
3. **Metadata Search**: Filter by camera model, date, location, etc.
4. **Tag Search**: Find photos by tags and collections

### Managing Photos Offline
1. **Favorites**: Mark photos as favorites (syncs when online)
2. **Tags**: Add/remove tags from photos (syncs when online)
3. **Collections**: Create and manage collections (syncs when online)
4. **Metadata**: Edit photo metadata (syncs when online)

## Performance Benefits

### Instant UI Response
- **Cached Results**: Previously searched queries return results immediately
- **Lazy Thumbnails**: Thumbnails load progressively for smooth browsing
- **Virtualized Grid**: Only visible photos are rendered for fast scrolling
- **Smart Prefetching**: Anticipates your needs and pre-loads data

### Efficient Storage
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatically manages cache size and expiration
- **Compression**: Compresses data to minimize storage usage
- **Selective Caching**: Prioritizes frequently accessed data
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes stale data to free up space

### Resource Management
- **Background Sync**: Synchronizes changes without interrupting your work
- **Battery Aware**: Reduces processing when on battery power
- **Network Throttling**: Adapts to available bandwidth
- **CPU Management**: Balances AI processing with other tasks

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage**: All data stays on your device
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Strict file system access permissions
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data sent without consent

### File System Security
- **Allowed Roots**: Only accesses explicitly permitted directories
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Secure IPC**: Protected inter-process communication
- **Sandboxing**: Runs in secure sandboxed environment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow First-Time Setup
**Problem**: Initial model preparation takes time
**Solution**: This is normal and only happens once. Let it complete without interruption.

#### Search Results Seem Off
**Problem**: Search results don't match expectations
**Solution**: 
- Try different search terms
- Enable OCR and caption features for better searchability
- Wait for full indexing to complete

#### Photos Not Appearing
**Problem**: Some photos don't show up in the library
**Solution**:
- Check that the photo directory is correctly selected
- Verify supported file formats (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, .bmp, .tiff)
- Force refresh the library

### Performance Issues

#### High CPU Usage
**Problem**: CPU usage spikes during indexing
**Solution**:
- Reduce the number of concurrent indexing threads in settings
- Schedule indexing during idle times
- Pause indexing when system resources are needed

#### Memory Pressure
**Problem**: High memory usage with large libraries
**Solution**:
- Reduce cache size in settings
- Limit the number of photos indexed at once
- Restart the application to clear memory

### Offline Operation Issues

#### Service Unavailable
**Problem**: Backend service crashes or becomes unresponsive
**Solution**:
- Use the "Restart Backend" option in the settings menu
- Check that your system meets the minimum requirements
- Review logs in the user data directory
