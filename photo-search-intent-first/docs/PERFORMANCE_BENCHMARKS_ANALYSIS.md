## Benchmark Results

### Memory Usage Analysis

#### Traditional Grid vs Virtualized Grid

| Collection Size | Traditional Grid | Virtualized Grid | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1,000 photos | 150MB | 50MB | **67% reduction** |
| 10,000 photos | 800MB | 180MB | **78% reduction** |
| 50,000 photos | 4GB+ | 300MB | **93% reduction** |

#### Memory Usage Over Time

```
Traditional Grid (50K photos):
Memory: 500MB → 1.2GB → 2.1GB → 4.1GB (crash)
Time:    0s     30s     60s     90s

Virtualized Grid (50K photos):
Memory: 120MB → 180MB → 250MB → 300MB (stable)
Time:    0s     30s     60s     90s
```

### Loading Time Analysis

#### Initial Load Performance

| Collection Size | Traditional Grid | Virtualized Grid | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|

Time: 60s+
Risk: High chance of crash

Progressive Loading:
Batch 1: 500 items (initial)
Batch 2-50: 1,000 items each
Memory: 300MB (stable)
Time: 8.5s (initial), full load in background
Risk: Minimal risk of crash
```

#### Predictive Preloading Benefits
