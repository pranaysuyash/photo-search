# User Guide: Virtualized Grid Features

## Overview

The Virtualized Grid is a powerful feature designed to handle large photo collections (50K+ photos) efficiently while maintaining smooth performance and excellent user experience. This guide explains how to use and benefit from the virtualized grid features.

## What is Virtualized Grid?

The Virtualized Grid is an intelligent photo browsing system that only renders the photos you can currently see on screen, rather than loading all photos at once. This approach provides:

- **Faster loading**: Photos appear quickly as you browse
- **Smooth scrolling**: No lag or jerkiness when scrolling through large collections
- **Memory efficiency**: Uses significantly less memory than traditional grids
- **Progressive loading**: Photos load in the background as you browse

## When is Virtualized Grid Used?

The application automatically switches to virtualized grid mode when:

- **Large collections**: More than 1,000 photos in a folder
- **Memory efficiency**: When memory usage would be high with traditional loading
- **Performance optimization**: When scrolling performance would be impacted

### Automatic Detection
The app intelligently detects when to use virtualized grid:

```
Collection Size → Loading Strategy
0-1,000 photos → Traditional Grid (all at once)
1,000+ photos → Virtualized Grid (progressive loading)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Progressive Loading

**What it does**: Photos load in batches as you browse, rather than all at once.

**Benefits**:
- Photos appear within seconds, not minutes
- You can start browsing immediately
- Background loading doesn't block your interaction

**Visual Indicators**:
- Loading spinner at the bottom while more photos load
- Smooth transitions between batches
- Progress indicators for large collections

### 2. Predictive Preloading

**What it does**: The app anticipates which photos you'll want to see next and loads them in advance.

**Benefits**:
- Photos are ready when you scroll to them
- No loading interruptions during browsing
- Smoother scrolling experience

**How it works**:
```
Current View: Photos 100-200
Preloading: Photos 200-300 (next batch)
Predictive: Photos 300-400 (future batch)
```

### 3. Memory Management

**What it does**: Automatically manages memory usage to prevent browser slowdowns or crashes.

**Benefits**:
- Stable performance with large collections
- No browser crashes due to memory issues
- Configurable memory limits

**Visual Indicators**:
- Memory usage display (when enabled)
- Automatic cleanup when limits are reached
- Performance alerts when memory is high

### 4. Performance Monitoring

**What it does**: Tracks and displays performance metrics in real-time.

**Benefits**:
- Transparency about system performance
- Early warning of potential issues
- Optimization insights

**Available Metrics**:
- Total items in collection
- Currently loaded items
- Memory usage
- Loading status
- Virtualization status
