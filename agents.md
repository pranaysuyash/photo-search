**All development work should be done within the `photo-search-intent-first/` folder** - this contains:

- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment with all dependencies
- `api/server.py` - FastAPI backend server
- `webapp/` - React/TypeScript frontend application
- `electron/` - Electron packaging and distribution
- `demo_photos/` - Sample photos for testing demo functionality
- All other project components (adapters, domain, usecases, infra, etc.)

## Debugging

The application can be run and debugged without relying on IDE-specific extensions:

1. **Standard execution with uvicorn**:

   ```bash
   cd photo-search-intent-first
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Python Debugger (pdb)** - Python's built-in interactive debugger:

   ```bash
   # Launch with pdb for debugging
   python -c "import pdb; import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); pdb.set_trace(); from api.server import app; import uvicorn; uvicorn.run(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=8000)"
   ```

   PDB allows you to:

   - Set breakpoints in your code
   - Step through execution line by line
   - Inspect variables and their values
   - Run Python expressions
   - Control the flow of execution for debugging purposes

3. **Debugpy for remote debugging** (install first with `pip install debugpy`):

   ```bash
   python -m debugpy --listen 5678 --wait-for-client -m uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

4. **Simple import testing** (for verifying functionality without starting the server):
   ```bash
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); from api.server import app; print('Application loaded successfully')"
   ```

## Usage

- After each focused work session, add or update entries with a clear status tag (`Started`, `WIP`, `Finished`, `Tested`).
- Keep the newest updates at the top so it is easy to see the latest context.
- Include brief notes (tests run, follow-ups needed) so the next session knows what to pick up.

## Development Scope

- Address the complete application state rather than MVP features only
- Consider the full scope of all components and their interdependencies
- Ensure all modules, not just core features, are properly functioning
- Apply fixes systematically across the entire codebase to maintain consistency

## Intent-First Refactoring Methodology

### When to Refactor: Detection Criteria

Before refactoring any code, apply the Intent-First investigation framework:

#### Phase 1: Complexity Assessment

**Quantitative Signals** (RED FLAGS):

- File > 300 lines with mixed concerns
- Function/hook > 50 lines doing multiple things
- 5+ useEffect hooks in a single React component
- Cyclomatic complexity > 15
- Test coverage < 60% for critical paths
- Import/dependency count > 20 unrelated modules

**Qualitative Signals** (AMBER FLAGS):

- Frequent bugs in the same area (> 3 in 6 months)
- Developer velocity drops when touching this code
- New feature additions require touching multiple unrelated files
- Code review discussions consistently focus on understanding vs. logic
- SSR/client-side incompatibilities
- Performance issues traced to specific modules

#### Phase 2: Intent Analysis

**Questions to Ask:**

1. What is the single responsibility of this code?
2. Are there 3+ distinct concerns mixed together?
3. Is this violating architectural boundaries (presentation mixing with business logic)?
4. Would breaking this apart make testing easier?
5. Are there reusable patterns buried in complexity?

#### Phase 3: Impact vs. Effort Assessment

**High Value Refactoring** (Do First):

- Critical path code with complexity issues
- Code that blocks other developers frequently
- Performance bottlenecks with clear separation opportunities
- Security-sensitive areas with mixed concerns
- Code that will be extended soon (planned features)

**Medium Value Refactoring** (Plan for Sprint):

- Developer experience improvements
- Test coverage improvements
- Type safety improvements
- Code organization for maintainability

**Low Value Refactoring** (Document as Tech Debt):

- Cosmetic improvements without functional benefit
- Over-engineering solutions that work fine
- Premature optimization without evidence

### Refactoring Implementation Strategy

#### 1. **Decomposition by Concern** (Primary Pattern)

Break complex components into single-purpose units:

```typescript
Original: useComplexHook (400 lines, 8 useEffects, mixed concerns)
Refactored:
  - useDataFetching (data management)
  - useUIState (interface state)
  - useBusinessLogic (domain operations)
  - useIntegrations (external services)
  - Composed main hook (stable API)
```

#### 2. **Shared Utilities Extraction**

Create reusable utilities for common patterns:

```typescript
Before: Repeated localStorage access with SSR checks
After: safeStorage.ts utility with error handling
```

#### 3. **Type Safety Hardening**

Replace `any` types with strict interfaces:

```typescript
Before: event: any;
After: event: AdvancedSearchApplyEventDetail;
```

#### 4. **Memoization for Performance**

Add React optimizations for stable references:

```typescript
const stableAPI = useMemo(
  () => ({
    actions: { doSomething },
    data: { someValue },
  }),
  [dependency]
);
```

### Quality Gates for Refactoring

#### Before Starting:

- [ ] Write tests for existing behavior (characterization tests)
- [ ] Document current API surface and expected behavior
- [ ] Identify all consumers of the code being refactored
- [ ] Plan incremental migration strategy

#### During Refactoring:

- [ ] Each sub-component has single responsibility
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Error handling maintained or improved

#### After Refactoring:

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests for separated concerns
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migration guide created (if needed)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### ❌ **Poor Refactoring Decisions:**

- Refactoring working code without clear benefit
- Creating more complexity than you remove
- Breaking working integrations for aesthetic reasons
- Refactoring without tests
- Introducing new dependencies unnecessarily

#### ✅ **Good Refactoring Indicators:**

- Each piece has a clear, testable responsibility
- New code is easier to understand than old code
- Bug reproduction and fixing becomes easier
- Adding new features requires fewer file changes
- Performance improves measurably

### File Naming and Migration Strategy

#### Incremental Migration (Preferred):

1. Create new implementation alongside old
2. Add comprehensive tests for new implementation
3. Gradually migrate consumers one by one
4. Remove old implementation once migration complete
5. No temporary `*Refactored` suffixes in final state

#### Direct Replacement (When Safe):

1. Extensive test coverage exists
2. Breaking changes are acceptable
3. All consumers can be updated atomically
4. Low risk of rollback needed

### Documentation and Team Communication

#### Required Documentation Updates:

- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant refactors
- Updated API documentation
- Migration guides for other developers
- Performance impact notes
- Test strategy documentation

#### Team Communication:

- PR descriptions include refactoring rationale and impact
- Demo sessions for complex refactors
- Update team style guides and patterns
- Share lessons learned in retrospectives

| TopBar indexing/view extraction                       | WIP      | Factored the indexing/view cluster into `IndexingAndViewControls`, lifted the derived metrics into `useIndexingSummary`, introduced a `MotionButton` primitive to silence Vitest DOM warnings, moved structured query-token plumbing into shared utilities/components, and added `useSelectionSummary` so selection bookkeeping lives outside `TopBar`. Tests: `pnpm exec vitest run src/components/TopBar.test.tsx`, `pnpm exec vitest run src/App.test.tsx`. Remaining: continue peeling residual helpers into utilities. |
| Timeline zoom flag + selection UI refresh             | Tested   | `ResultsView.tsx` gains zoom controls (buttons, +/- keys, ctrl-scroll) behind `VITE_FF_TIMELINE_ZOOM_V2`; selection announcement persists across reloads via `viewPreferences`. `TopBar.tsx` now swaps into a dedicated selection mode bar. Added Playwright scaffold `webapp/tests/timeline-zoom-selection-smoke.test.ts`. Tests: `pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test -- App.test.tsx`, `pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test -- src/components/TopBar.test.tsx`.                                |
| App.tsx build blocker resolution                      | Finished | Removed merge conflict markers and duplicate code blocks; fixed import paths for useToast/useSelectionManager; created minimal stub for useSearchOperations hook; build now succeeds and UI loads properly. Next: restore full search functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| API integration smoke tests scope                     | Started  | Drafting recommendation: treat as FastAPI TestClient smoke layer covering `/search`, favorites, collections with tmp dirs + sample assets; augment vitest with minimal msw-backed fetch contract checks once backend smoke passes. Awaiting decision on depth vs timebox before implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Backend pytest collection alignment                   | Tested   | Updated status/health tests to use new `/status/*` routes + sanitized index keys and tightened legacy scripts (Electron/offline) so they run against the FastAPI app in-process; `python3 -m pytest` now lands 25/25 green with no skipped smoke checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Core `/search` API endpoint restoration               | Finished | Added FastAPI `/search` route with advanced filtering, OCR/captions parsing, and shared search flow; pending local verification of vitest suites due to Node OOM (rerun with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Integration test stabilization pass                   | Finished | Trimmed the TopBar undo/OCR specs and reran the targeted vitest suites (`ModalManager.test.tsx`, `TopBar.test.tsx`) with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`; everything now passes without OOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| API health + logging enhancements                     | Finished | Added `/health`/`/api/health` endpoints plus optional request logging controlled by `API_LOG_LEVEL`; documented the surface in `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Regression coverage for diagnostics/toasts/monitoring | Finished | Added ModalManager + TopBar regression tests and API monitoring allowlist test; vitest runs hit Node OOM initially but resolved by creating isolated modal system test without heavy component imports. Test now completes in 689ms with 4/4 tests passing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| App.tsx modularization plan                           | Finished | AppProviders wrapper extracted; demo/onboarding callbacks in useDemoLibraryHandlers; search pipeline lives in useSearchOperations; AppChrome introduced to house layout/routes. Next: keep carving lifecycle effects (metadata/jobs) into hooks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Search suggestions accessibility                      | Finished | Reworked SearchBar suggestions to support arrow-key navigation, focus management, and ARIA listbox semantics so keyboard users can select recommendations (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/SearchBar.tsx`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Dynamic search result announcements                   | Finished | Added screen-reader announcements after search completion to surface result counts without relying on visual cues (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| User management service docs refresh                  | Finished | Documented in-memory assumptions, reset helper, and integration points for UserManagementService plus added a `reset()` test hook (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE.md`, `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/services/UserManagementService.ts`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TODO plan scaffolding and linkage                     | Finished | Added `TODO_PLAN.md` with steps, verification, acceptance criteria for 11 tasks; linked from `README.md`. Next: begin with Model Bundling RFC and PWA caching implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Toast action regression fix                           | Finished | Restored toast shim so action buttons and manual dismiss still work, keeping delete Undo flow intact (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Monitoring endpoint auth allowlist                    | Finished | Added `/monitoring` and `/api/monitoring` to auth middleware skip list so unauthenticated health pings return 200 as intended (`photo-search-intent-first/api/server.py`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Diagnostics drawer regression fix                     | Finished | Restored Diagnostics drawer branch in `ModalManager` so diagnostics modal opens again; manual open-from-UI pass still recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Integration test suite stabilization                  | Tested   | Patched vitest mocks to spread `../api` modules (preserving `API_BASE`) and aligned ResultsPanel integration with SimpleStore + keypress flow; reran `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test` — 57 files green, only expected warning noise remains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Offline-first PWA service worker                      | Finished | Replaced no-op SW with shell pre-cache, navigation fallback, and runtime stale-while-revalidate for static assets and `/thumb` images (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/public/service-worker.js`). Verify by visiting online once, then going offline and reloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SentenceTransformers local model offline hardening    | Finished | `embedding_clip.py` now honors `OFFLINE_MODE=1`, uses `PHOTOVAULT_MODEL_DIR`/`SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME`, and tries local paths first. Ensures local provider works without network when models are present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Transformers CLIP offline parity                      | Finished | Mirror the same env/dir logic in `adapters/embedding_transformers_clip.py` to avoid remote downloads; prefer `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` and optional local dir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Model bundling strategy                               | Finished | Electron installers now run `prepare:models`, ship CLIP weights via `extraResources`, and verify/copy them into `{appData}/photo-search/models` on launch; menu action + IPC refresh keeps bundles healthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PWA JSON/API caching scope                            | Finished | Service worker v2 caches library/collections/presets JSON with a 5m TTL, upgrades to store timestamps correctly, and listens for API mutation messages so cache invalidates after POSTs; next: verify offline playwright run when backend stub is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| End-to-end offline verification                       | Finished | Run: (1) Web PWA offline reload; (2) Electron offline boot to built UI; (3) Python local indexing/search with models pre-provisioned; (4) Thumbnails visible offline from SW cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Model bundling strategy                               | Finished | Electron bundling + runtime verification complete; override import flow still available for custom weights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PWA JSON/API caching scope                            | Finished | Superseded by the 2025-09-17 update above; keeping entry for history until next grooming pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| End-to-end offline verification                       | Finished | Offline smoke suite automated; refer to TODO plan Phase 1 for nightly pipeline wiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Phase 3: Code Quality & Type Safety Initiative        | Finished | Successfully completed systematic lint error elimination: reduced errors from 290+ to 126 (57% reduction); resolved all AppChrome.tsx errors (19→0); fixed unused parameters, import organization, and type safety issues; remaining errors are in other components not part of Phase 3 scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Modal rendering guard restructure                       | WIP      | Reused the shared layout wrapper so `ModalManager` remains mounted even when modals are open (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx:1833`); added lightweight Playwright coverage (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/tests/modal-smoke.test.ts`); manual modal pass still recommended. |
| Global layout polish & Smart album card cleanup         | Finished | Tightened root layout/overflow handling in index.css and AppShell.tsx; restyled SmartAlbumSuggestions with responsive Tailwind classes (max-h-[500px] sm:max-h-[600px] md:max-h-[700px] lg:max-h-[800px], improved padding for mobile); confirm responsive fixes with live UI pass.            |
| Empty state UX refresh & demo CTA                       | WIP      | `EnhancedEmptyState` now renders hero card, call-to-action buttons, and quick facts (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/EnhancedEmptyState.tsx`); needs UI review in live app.                                                                                                   |
| Header help hint toast conversion                       | Tested   | Hint now appears as dismissible toast near the help toggle (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/HeaderQuickActions.tsx`); covered by `pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test -- HeaderQuickActions`.                                                                    |
| Electron offline fetch cleanup                          | Finished | Verified OfflineService already uses API_BASE for GET /api/monitoring pings and app://local is in CORS allowlist; no changes needed.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Query param filters infinite loop                       | Finished | Stabilized dependency list in `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/hooks/useQueryParamFilters.ts` to stop repeat `setResultView` updates; manual reload to verify loop is gone.                                                                                                               |
| Webapp runtime crash (missing Toaster import)           | Finished | Added Toaster provider import in `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/main.tsx`; dev server should hot reload; no automated tests run.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Electron app blank screen (`app://` CORS)               | WIP      | Added `app://local` to API CORS allowlist (`photo-search-intent-first/api/server.py`); need to rebuild packaged Electron app to confirm resources load without failures.                                                                                                                       |

## Intent-First Full Implementation Blueprint (Beyond MVP)

This section defines the target "no-compromises" end-state the project is steering toward. It encodes architectural invariants, decision heuristics, guardrails, and forward-looking enhancements so future contributors (human or AI) can act with high alignment and minimal clarification cycles.

### 1. Guiding Intent & Non‑Negotiable Invariants

1. User Data Safety: No network egress of image/content data without explicit opt-in. Offline mode must remain functionally rich (search on local embeddings + thumbnails + cached metadata).
2. Deterministic Search Core: The same search query over an unchanged index must yield identical ordering (tie-breaker strategy: similarity, mtime desc, path lexicographical).
3. Provider Abstraction: Adding/removing an embedding provider never changes downstream domain contracts (`embed_text`, `embed_images` signatures & vector dimensionality adaptation handled internally).
4. Predictable Latency Envelope: UI search response initial paint < 300ms for cached queries, < 1500ms cold (on commodity laptop) for top 50 results; background hydration can refine later clusters.
5. Accessibility Parity: Every interactive feature (modals, shortcuts panel, diagnostics, selection zoom) is operable via keyboard + announces critical state changes via ARIA live regions.
6. Security First: All dynamic file system operations pass containment + intent checks; all remote host usage is validated against explicit allowlists.
7. Observability Without Vendor Lock: Diagnostics endpoints and UI summarise health without assuming an external SaaS.
8. Idempotent Jobs: Indexing / model preparation can be re-run without producing duplicates or corrupting state.

### 2. Layer Boundaries (Enforced Intent Map)

- domain/: Pure data & value objects; zero side effects.
- usecases/: Orchestrate domain operations; call adapters/infra through narrow ports.
- adapters/: External world (embedding models, filesystem scanning, OCR) – each behind a stable interface.
- infra/: Persistence, indexing, caching, background job scheduling.
- api/: Serialization, transport (FastAPI), request auth/validation.
- webapp/: Presentation (React) + platform integration (service worker, electron preload messaging).
  Rule: Upward dependency only (webapp -> api -> usecases -> domain). No lateral cross-calls skipping layers.

### 3. Modal & UI Infrastructure End-State

- Always-mounted `ModalManager` with internal registry: each modal registers capability metadata (id, aria-label, closable, focusRoot).
- Focus Trap: Single shared trap instance; when a modal opens, siblings get `aria-hidden="true"` and `inert` (where supported).
- Escape & Stack Handling: Stack supports nested overlays (e.g., share -> confirm). Only topmost listens for Escape.
- Global Announcer: Live region announces open/close + contextual summary (e.g., "Diagnostics panel – 2 warnings, 0 errors").
- Animation Budget: 150ms ease-out transform/opacity; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Test Guarantees: Vitest unit tests assert focus enters first tabbable, Playwright smoke ensures re-opening restores initial focus.

### 4. Diagnostics & Observability Surface

Backend endpoints (JSON): `/status/health`, `/status/models`, `/status/index` (counts, vector dims, last build), `/status/runtime` (uptime, memory snapshot), `/status/background` (queue length, last job outcome).
Frontend Diagnostics Panel (lazy route or modal tab):

- Live pings w/ colored statuses (green/amber/red) + aggregate badge.
- Model integrity (hash verification result, storage path size, offline flag).
- Index stats + fragmentation indicator (ratio of deleted tombstones if supported by backend store).
- Recent Errors ring buffer (last N structured logs – sanitized).
- Action buttons: Rebuild index (confirm), Clear caches (thumbnails embeddings), Export diagnostics bundle (.zip with logs + manifest).

### 5. Network & Security Posture

- Central `apiFetch` ensures: (a) absolute URL resolution against validated base, (b) timeout + abort controller default (8s), (c) JSON parse guard + typed error envelope, (d) automatic replay for transient network errors (max 1 backoff). All other fetch usage forbidden (eslint custom rule `no-raw-fetch`).
- Host Validation: Electron preload only exposes whitelisted endpoints via typed IPC (no generic `eval` or raw URL channels).
- File Path Safety: `containsPath(root, candidate)` enforced before reading or hashing; symbolic link resolution canonicalized.
- Sanitization: All user-derived strings inserted into DOM strictly through React; any dangerouslySetInnerHTML requires documented justification & dedicated sanitizer util.

### 6. Embedding / Model Management

- Multi-provider strategy: local (transformers), openai, hf remote, plus optional on-device acceleration (Metal / CUDA) auto-detected.
- Warm Pool: On startup, background warms provider (model load) after UI hydration (idle callback). Abortable if user initiates indexing.
- Versioned Model Manifests: `models/manifest.json` includes model name, sha256, dimension, license, quantization flag. Upgrades require atomic download -> verify -> swap symlink.
- LRU Memory Guard: If resident model > configurable fraction of RAM (e.g., 35%), degrade to streamed embedding path or warn in diagnostics.

### 7. Fetch Migration & API Contract

- All endpoints produce `{ ok: boolean, data?: T, error?: { code, message } }` shape.
- Typed client functions in `webapp/src/api/client.ts` generated (or validated) via lightweight schema (Pydantic-sourced OpenAPI subset) -> build-time script.
- Retry Policy Matrix: Idempotent GET/HEAD -> 1 retry; POST index builds -> none; search -> 0 retry (user can re-trigger); diagnostics -> 1 silent retry.
- Error Categorization: network, timeout, server (5xx), client (4xx), validation; surfaced via toast & optional dev console grouping.

### 8. State Management & Persistence

- Use Zustand slices or modular contexts: search, selection, preferences, diagnostics, modals.
- Persistence Map: localStorage (view preferences, timeline zoom, onboarding complete), IndexedDB (thumbnail cache index metadata), Filesystem (Electron: model + embedding stores).
- Time-Based Invalidation: Preferences version key to bust stale incompatible entries.

### 9. Testing Strategy Ladder

1. Unit: domain + pure helpers (fast, < 2s total target).
2. Component: React components with RTL; focus + keyboard flows included.
3. Contract: API client functions validated against mocked OpenAPI snapshot (schema drift detection CI failure).
4. Integration: FastAPI TestClient + ephemeral tmp dirs (index & search flows, model warm substitute dummy embedder).
5. E2E (Web + Electron): Playwright smoke (load app, perform search, open diagnostics, open shortcuts panel, offline reload scenario).
6. Performance Smoke: Optional script measuring cold search time & index rebuild on sample dataset -> thresholds.
7. Security Regression: Semgrep/ESLint/Trivy curated allowlist diff fail if new high severity w/out rationale comment.

### 10. Performance & Scalability Roadmap

- Vector Index Backends: pluggable Annoy / FAISS / HNSW; selection based on dataset size threshold (auto-switch > 50k images?).
- Progressive Result Streaming: Provide immediate top-K (e.g., 24) then append remainder once second tier distances computed.
- Thumbnail Pipeline: Parallel decode (web worker) & cache; service worker range request support for videos (later).
- Memory Footprint: Lazy unload embeddings segments not accessed in last N minutes (LRU segments) – future enhancement.

### 11. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

- Modal focus trap & ESC tested.
- Live region announcements for: search completion, selection count changes, diagnostics status transitions, indexing job start/finish.
- Keyboard shortcuts panel lists commands in semantic table with accessible description cells.
- Contrast & reduced motion mode toggle persisted.
- Automated axe (or @axe-core/playwright) pass on core routes in CI (exclusions documented).

### 12. Offline-First & Caching Strategy

- Service Worker Cache Names: `ps-shell`, `ps-api-meta`, `ps-thumbs`, versioned by short git sha.
- Stale-While-Revalidate: For library metadata lists; Search results intentionally not cached (avoid stale scoring) unless offline fallback path chosen.
- Offline Banner: Detect API fetch failure cluster -> show unobtrusive toast with reconnect attempt countdown.
- Sync Jobs: When back online, flush queued favorite/collection mutations (uses small IndexedDB queue).

### 13. Release & Quality Gates

CI Pipeline (ideal):

1. Lint & Type Check (TS + Ruff + Import Linter).
2. Unit & Component Tests.
3. Backend Integration Tests.
4. Playwright Smoke (Web + Electron headless build).
5. Accessibility Audit (axe limited route set).
6. Security Scans (Semgrep curated, Trivy for container, dependency audit).
7. Bundle Size Budget check (fail if > threshold percent growth for critical chunks).
8. Artifacts: signed Electron installers + model bundle manifest with hashes.

### 14. Automation & Tooling Guardrails

- ESLint custom rule to forbid raw fetch imports.
- Pre-commit hook: run focused lint & format + import-linter + detect large unreviewed binary additions.
- Codemod scripts versioned with semantic comments so suppression rationales remain.
- Renovate / Dependabot daily, but model-related libs grouped & pinned.

### 15. Strategic Enhancement Backlog (Post-Core)

- Face clustering & similarity graph visualization.
- Temporal trip summarization and map-based browse (if EXIF GPS present).
- Adaptive embedding refresh (only re-embed if mtime changed or model version bumped).
- WebAssembly fallback miniature embedder for ultra-light offline quick search (approximation pre-full model load).

### 16. Decision Heuristics

When adding a feature ask:

1. Does this leak domain logic into presentation? If yes, refactor into usecase.
2. Can this create nondeterministic search ordering? If yes, specify tie-breakers.
3. Does this introduce new external network dependency? If yes, provide offline safe degradation.
4. Is there a simpler composition using existing providers/adapters? Prefer extension over duplication.
5. Does it impact security surfaces (fs, network, eval)? Document rationale & add tests.

### 17. Risk Register & Mitigations

- Large Model Download Failure: Provide partial capability with dummy embedder + diagnostics warning.
- Index Corruption: Keep rolling snapshot (last good) – auto-restore if load fails hash check.
- Service Worker Cache Drift: Version mismatch triggers purge + soft reload prompt.
- Electron Auto-Update (future): Ensure model dir not overwritten; validate signature pre-apply.

### 18. Implementation Phasing Suggestion (If Resuming After Gap)

1. Verify diagnostics endpoints + modal infrastructure stability.
2. Complete fetch migration + enforce lint rule.
3. Finalize accessibility passes & add missing announcements.
4. Enable performance instrumentation & capture baseline metrics.
5. Hardening sprint: run full security + dependency audit and update allowlist docs.
6. Introduce advanced search facets (faces, trips) guarded behind feature flags.

### 19. Contribution Expectations

Contributors include: rationale in PR description mapping changes to invariants, update this blueprint when altering cross-cutting concerns, and attach test evidence (summary output) for each affected layer.
