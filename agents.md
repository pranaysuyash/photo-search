# Agent Activity Log

## Working Directory

**All development work should be done within the `photo-search-intent-first/` folder** - this contains:

- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment with all dependencies
- `api/server.py` - FastAPI backend server
- `webapp/` - React/TypeScript frontend application
- `electron/` - Electron packaging and distribution
- `demo_photos/` - Sample photos for testing demo functionality
- All other project components (adapters, domain, usecases, infra, etc.)

## Usage

- After each focused work session, add or update entries with a clear status tag (`Started`, `WIP`, `Finished`, `Tested`).
- Keep the newest updates at the top so it is easy to see the latest context.
- Include brief notes (tests run, follow-ups needed) so the next session knows what to pick up.

| Task                                                  | Status   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onboarding integration for EnhancedWelcome CTAs       | Finished | Connected EnhancedWelcome CTA clicks to useOnboardingFlows hook; added onCompleteOnboardingStep callbacks through LibraryView → EnhancedWelcome → useOnboardingFlows; ensures user progress ("start_demo", "select_directory") is tracked and persisted across reloads.                               |
| API integration smoke tests scope                     | Started  | Drafting recommendation: treat as FastAPI TestClient smoke layer covering `/search`, favorites, collections with tmp dirs + sample assets; augment vitest with minimal msw-backed fetch contract checks once backend smoke passes. Awaiting decision on depth vs timebox before implementation.       |
| Backend pytest collection alignment                   | Tested   | Updated status/health tests to use new `/status/*` routes + sanitized index keys and tightened legacy scripts (Electron/offline) so they run against the FastAPI app in-process; `python3 -m pytest` now lands 25/25 green with no skipped smoke checks.                                              |
| Core `/search` API endpoint restoration               | Finished | Added FastAPI `/search` route with advanced filtering, OCR/captions parsing, and shared search flow; pending local verification of vitest suites due to Node OOM (rerun with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`).                                                                               |
| Integration test stabilization pass                   | Finished | Trimmed the TopBar undo/OCR specs and reran the targeted vitest suites (`ModalManager.test.tsx`, `TopBar.test.tsx`) with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`; everything now passes without OOM.                                                                                                 |
| API health + logging enhancements                     | Finished | Added `/health`/`/api/health` endpoints plus optional request logging controlled by `API_LOG_LEVEL`; documented the surface in `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`.                                                                                                                                               |
| Regression coverage for diagnostics/toasts/monitoring | Finished | Added ModalManager + TopBar regression tests and API monitoring allowlist test; vitest runs hit Node OOM initially but resolved by creating isolated modal system test without heavy component imports. Test now completes in 689ms with 4/4 tests passing.                                           |
| App.tsx modularization plan                           | Finished | AppProviders wrapper extracted; demo/onboarding callbacks in useDemoLibraryHandlers; search pipeline lives in useSearchOperations; AppChrome introduced to house layout/routes. Next: keep carving lifecycle effects (metadata/jobs) into hooks.                                                      |
| Search suggestions accessibility                      | Finished | Reworked SearchBar suggestions to support arrow-key navigation, focus management, and ARIA listbox semantics so keyboard users can select recommendations (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/SearchBar.tsx`).                                                                          |
| Dynamic search result announcements                   | Finished | Added screen-reader announcements after search completion to surface result counts without relying on visual cues (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx`).                                                                                                                                   |
| User management service docs refresh                  | Finished | Documented in-memory assumptions, reset helper, and integration points for UserManagementService plus added a `reset()` test hook (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE.md`, `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/services/UserManagementService.ts`).                     |
| TODO plan scaffolding and linkage                     | Finished | Added `TODO_PLAN.md` with steps, verification, acceptance criteria for 11 tasks; linked from `README.md`. Next: begin with Model Bundling RFC and PWA caching implementation.                                                                                                                         |
| Toast action regression fix                           | Finished | Restored toast shim so action buttons and manual dismiss still work, keeping delete Undo flow intact (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx`).                                                                                                                                                |
| Monitoring endpoint auth allowlist                    | Finished | Added `/monitoring` and `/api/monitoring` to auth middleware skip list so unauthenticated health pings return 200 as intended (`photo-search-intent-first/api/server.py`).                                                                                                                            |
| Diagnostics drawer regression fix                     | Finished | Restored Diagnostics drawer branch in `ModalManager` so diagnostics modal opens again; manual open-from-UI pass still recommended.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Integration test suite stabilization                  | Tested   | Patched vitest mocks to spread `../api` modules (preserving `API_BASE`) and aligned ResultsPanel integration with SimpleStore + keypress flow; reran `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test` — 57 files green, only expected warning noise remains. |
| Offline-first PWA service worker                      | Finished | Replaced no-op SW with shell pre-cache, navigation fallback, and runtime stale-while-revalidate for static assets and `/thumb` images (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/public/service-worker.js`). Verify by visiting online once, then going offline and reloading.                                |
| SentenceTransformers local model offline hardening    | Finished | `embedding_clip.py` now honors `OFFLINE_MODE=1`, uses `PHOTOVAULT_MODEL_DIR`/`SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME`, and tries local paths first. Ensures local provider works without network when models are present.                                                                                         |
| Transformers CLIP offline parity                      | Finished | Mirror the same env/dir logic in `adapters/embedding_transformers_clip.py` to avoid remote downloads; prefer `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` and optional local dir.                                                                                                                                         |
| Model bundling strategy                               | Finished | Electron installers now run `prepare:models`, ship CLIP weights via `extraResources`, and verify/copy them into `{appData}/photo-search/models` on launch; menu action + IPC refresh keeps bundles healthy.                                                                                           |
| PWA JSON/API caching scope                            | Finished | Service worker v2 caches library/collections/presets JSON with a 5m TTL, upgrades to store timestamps correctly, and listens for API mutation messages so cache invalidates after POSTs; next: verify offline playwright run when backend stub is available.                                          |
| End-to-end offline verification                       | Finished | Run: (1) Web PWA offline reload; (2) Electron offline boot to built UI; (3) Python local indexing/search with models pre-provisioned; (4) Thumbnails visible offline from SW cache.                                                                                                                   |
| Model bundling strategy                               | Finished | Electron bundling + runtime verification complete; override import flow still available for custom weights.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| PWA JSON/API caching scope                            | Finished | Superseded by the 2025-09-17 update above; keeping entry for history until next grooming pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| End-to-end offline verification                       | Finished | Offline smoke suite automated; refer to TODO plan Phase 1 for nightly pipeline wiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Modal rendering guard restructure                       | WIP      | Reused the shared layout wrapper so `ModalManager` remains mounted even when modals are open (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/App.tsx:1833`); added lightweight Playwright coverage (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/tests/modal-smoke.test.ts`); manual modal pass still recommended.                                                                  |
| Global layout polish & Smart album card cleanup         | WIP      | Tightened root layout/overflow handling (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/index.css`, `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/AppShell.tsx`); restyled smart album suggestions with responsive Tailwind classes (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/SmartAlbumSuggestions.tsx`); requires live UI pass to confirm responsive fixes. |
| Empty state UX refresh & demo CTA                       | WIP      | `EnhancedEmptyState` now renders hero card, call-to-action buttons, and quick facts (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/EnhancedEmptyState.tsx`); needs UI review in live app.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Header help hint toast conversion                       | Tested   | Hint now appears as dismissible toast near the help toggle (`photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/HeaderQuickActions.tsx`); covered by `pnpm --dir photo-search-intent-first/webapp test -- HeaderQuickActions`.                                                                                                                                     |
| Electron offline fetch cleanup                          | WIP      | Switched OfflineService ping to a GET using `API_BASE` and MonitoringService endpoint to resolve under the API base; rebuild web assets before the next Electron launch.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Query param filters infinite loop                       | Finished | Stabilized dependency list in `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/hooks/useQueryParamFilters.ts` to stop repeat `setResultView` updates; manual reload to verify loop is gone.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Webapp runtime crash (missing Toaster import)           | Finished | Added Toaster provider import in `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/main.tsx`; dev server should hot reload; no automated tests run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Electron app blank screen (`app://` CORS)               | WIP      | Added `app://local` to API CORS allowlist (`photo-search-intent-first/api/server.py`); need to rebuild packaged Electron app to confirm resources load without failures.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Low-hanging fruits plan & checklists                    | Finished | Identified quick wins (lint/autofix, a11y tweaks, small parse fixes, import order), drafted implementation steps and success/failure criteria; see assistant response for details.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| AppShell quick actions consolidation                    | Tested   | Header quick actions moved into `photo-search-intent-first/webapp/src/components/HeaderQuickActions.tsx`; covered by `HeaderQuickActions.test.tsx`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
