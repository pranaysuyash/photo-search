- **Status**: Basic PWA setup exists
- **Issue**: Limited offline functionality beyond service worker
- **Impact**: Reduced utility when offline

### ❌ **Missing or Broken**

#### 1. Test Infrastructure Issues
- **Problem**: Mock configurations incomplete in test files
- **Impact**: Some integration tests fail, reducing confidence in implementation
- **Files Affected**: `App.test.tsx`, related store mocks

#### 2. User Management Service Documentation
- **Problem**: `USER_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE.md` exists but content appears missing
- **Impact**: Unclear implementation guidance for user-related features

#### 3. Automated Accessibility Testing
- **Problem**: No automated accessibility tests in CI/CD
- **Impact**: Accessibility regressions could go undetected

## Conclusion

The Photo Search application demonstrates a sophisticated, user-centric approach with comprehensive UX implementation. The core user flows are functional and follow Intent-First principles. While there are areas for improvement (particularly in accessibility completeness and test infrastructure), the application provides a solid foundation for photo management with strong attention to user experience across multiple platforms.

The development team has successfully implemented a complex application with proper separation of concerns, responsive design, and accessibility foundations. The remaining work focuses on refinement and enhancement rather than fixing fundamental issues.
