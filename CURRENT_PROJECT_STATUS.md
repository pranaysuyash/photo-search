### Critical User Adoption Gaps Identified

1. **Empty States**: Need helpful guidance and CTAs for no-results, no-photos, no-collections states
2. **Demo Library**: Users need ability to evaluate without providing their own photos
3. **Help System**: Intent-First version needs help modal implementation
4. **Onboarding Completion**: Ensure first-run experience achieves time-to-value within 90 seconds

### Next Priority Actions

1. Implement enhanced empty states with sample search suggestions and QuickActions
2. Add demo workspace toggle for evaluation without user photos
3. Complete help system implementation for Intent-First
4. Validate onboarding flow effectiveness

This updated status reflects the current implementation reality and prioritizes user adoption improvements that will have the highest impact on reducing abandonment and increasing engagement.
