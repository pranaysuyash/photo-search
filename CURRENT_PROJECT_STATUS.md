## 8. Documentation Status

### Completed Documents
- Comprehensive feature analysis
- Detailed UI/UX evaluation
- NLP/search/indexing analysis
- Metadata analysis
- Implementation priorities
- Git workflow reference
- Evaluation of both approaches
- Codex recent work status

### Ongoing Documentation Needs
- Update documentation to reflect recent Codex changes
- Create user guides for new features
- Developer documentation for collections API

## 9. Recent Progress Summary

Codex has made significant progress on several high-priority items:
- Enhanced the Intent-First version with advanced collections management
- Implemented query expansion MVP
- Improved filmstrip view with keyboard navigation
- Added relevance feedback enhancements
- Created welcome wizard and help system for Classic version

This work has addressed several items from our "Ready to Implement" list and moved the project forward significantly. The next focus should be on promoting the collections UI to a dedicated section in Intent-First and implementing the help/wizard systems to achieve feature parity between versions.
