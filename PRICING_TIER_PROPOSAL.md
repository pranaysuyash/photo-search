# Pricing Tier Proposal

Goal: Offer a clear, fair one‑time license for local, with an optional tier that unlocks AI‑assisted features (BYO API keys). Keep privacy-first positioning.

## Tiers

### Local (One‑time, per device): $49 USD
- Private, on‑device search (local CLIP models)
- Fast indices (FAISS / HNSW / Annoy) when installed
- OCR (EasyOCR) with multi-language support
- Duplicates & near-duplicates, compare/keep-best tools
- Favorites, tags (bulk), collections, saved and smart albums
- EXIF metadata filters and map view (offline reverse geocoding)
- People (faces) when local engine/InsightFace is available
- 1 year of updates; lifetime use on that device

### Local + AI Add‑ons (One‑time, per device): $89 USD
- Everything in Local
- Optional AI helpers: cloud captioning/embedding and future AI-driven search refinements
- BYO provider keys (HF/OpenAI); keys never stored unless user opts in
- Priority support; 1 year of updates

Notes
- Optional future: AI Helper subscription (if hosting server-side compute) at $8–12/mo. Not required for BYO-key model.
- Regional pricing: consider 20–30% reductions in price-sensitive regions (Gumroad supports this).
- Refunds: 14 days, no questions asked. Make this explicit on the landing page.

## Rationale
- Local‑only one‑time aligns with privacy-first tools and reduces purchase friction.
- AI add‑ons justify a higher tier without adding variable cost (BYO keys).
- Clear tier distinction prevents confusion and supports upsell.

## Landing Page Copy (Short)
- Headline: “Pay once. Private forever.”
- Subhead: “Local search is 100% on your device. Add AI only if you want.”
- CTA: “Buy Local” and “Buy Local + AI Add‑ons”
- Legal: Refund window, VAT note, device activation, upgrade path for a second device.
