# New Tasks to Implement (Not Started Yet)

## High Priority - High Impact, Low Complexity
1. **Search History Feature** - Why it matters: Users frequently repeat searches and need quick access to recent queries. Estimated effort: 2-3 days
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Why it matters: Improves discoverability of keyboard shortcuts and enhances productivity. Estimated effort: 1-2 days
3. **Filter Presets** - Why it matters: Power users apply the same filter combinations repeatedly; saving presets would dramatically speed up workflows. Estimated effort: 2-3 days
4. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Why it matters: Small visual enhancements that improve perceived quality and user experience. Estimated effort: 1-2 days

## Medium Priority - Medium Impact/Complexity  
1. **Boolean Search Operators** - Why it matters: Enables more precise searches with AND/OR/NOT logic for users with large libraries. Estimated effort: 3-5 days
2. **Color-Based Search** - Why it matters: Allows searching by dominant colors, which many photo apps offer as a standard feature. Estimated effort: 4-6 days
3. **Bulk Rename Feature** - Why it matters: Essential for organizing large photo collections with pattern-based naming. Estimated effort: 3-4 days
4. **Pet Grouping** - Why it matters: Separates pet recognition from people in face detection, meeting user expectations. Estimated effort: 3-4 days

## Lower Priority - Complex or Niche Features
1. **Reverse Geocoding** - Why it matters: Converts GPS coordinates to place names for better location filtering, but is technically complex. Estimated effort: 5-7 days
2. **Denoise/Deblur Presets** - Why it matters: Adds image enhancement options for noisy/blurry photos, but requires careful implementation. Estimated effort: 4-6 days
3. **Background Removal** - Why it matters: Integrates Rembg for removing backgrounds from images, but has significant dependencies. Estimated effort: 5-7 days
4. **Electron Packaging** - Why it matters: Creates desktop applications for macOS/Windows, expanding distribution but requiring platform expertise. Estimated effort: 6-10 days
