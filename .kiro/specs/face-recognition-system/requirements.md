# Face Recognition System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive face recognition and people management system that enables users to automatically identify, organize, and search photos by the people in them. The system uses advanced face detection and recognition algorithms while maintaining strict privacy controls and local-only processing.

The face recognition system integrates seamlessly with the photo management application to provide intelligent people-based organization, automatic tagging, and powerful search capabilities while ensuring user privacy through local-only AI processing.
