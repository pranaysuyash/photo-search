# Data Import/Export and Migration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive data import, export, and migration system that enables users to move their photo collections, metadata, and organization between different systems and storage locations. The system ensures data portability, preserves user investment in organization, and facilitates smooth transitions between photo management solutions.

The import/export system provides robust data migration capabilities while maintaining data integrity, preserving relationships, and supporting various data formats and photo management systems to ensure users maintain control over their photo data.
