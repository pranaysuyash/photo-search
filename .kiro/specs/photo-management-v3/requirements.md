# Photo Management Application V3 - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive, offline-first photo management and search application. The application leverages AI-powered semantic search, advanced organization features, and intelligent automation to help users manage large photo collections efficiently. Built with modern web technologies and packaged as a desktop application, it provides a native experience while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

The application focuses on local-first operation with AI models bundled for offline functionality, ensuring user privacy and performance. Future phases will expand to include online AI services and cloud synchronization capabilities.
