# Advanced Filtering System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines an advanced filtering system that leverages the existing FastAPI backend and frontend infrastructure to provide comprehensive photo search and filtering capabilities. The system will identify, standardize, and enhance base filtration criteria across all photo metadata, EXIF data, AI-generated content, and user-defined attributes.

## Glossary

- **Filter_System**: The comprehensive filtering engine that processes search queries and applies multiple filter criteria
- **Base_Criteria**: Core filtration parameters including metadata, EXIF, location, temporal, and content-based filters
- **Filter_Engine**: The backend component that executes filter logic and returns filtered results
- **Filter_UI**: The frontend interface components that allow users to configure and apply filters
- **Smart_Filter**: AI-powered filters that use semantic understanding and content analysis
- **Compound_Filter**: Complex filters that combine multiple criteria with logical operators
- **Filter_Preset**: Saved filter configurations that users can quickly apply
- **Dynamic_Filter**: Filters that adapt based on available metadata and content analysis results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a photographer with a large photo library, I want to use comprehensive filtering options to quickly find specific photos based on any combination of technical, temporal, location, and content criteria, so that I can efficiently organize and locate my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the search interface, THE Filter_System SHALL display all available filter categories with current photo library statistics
2. WHEN a user selects multiple filter criteria, THE Filter_Engine SHALL apply compound filtering with logical AND/OR operations
3. WHEN a user applies filters, THE Filter_System SHALL return results within 2 seconds for libraries up to 50,000 photos
4. WHEN filter results are displayed, THE Filter_UI SHALL show the number of matching photos and applied filter summary
5. WHERE advanced filtering is enabled, THE Filter_System SHALL support nested filter groups with parenthetical logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to create and save complex filter presets that combine technical camera settings, AI-detected content, and user metadata, so that I can quickly apply sophisticated search criteria for recurring workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures multiple filters, THE Filter_System SHALL provide options to save the configuration as a named preset
2. WHEN a user saves a filter preset, THE Filter_Engine SHALL store the complete filter configuration including all parameters and logical operators
3. WHEN a user loads a saved preset, THE Filter_System SHALL restore all filter settings and immediately apply them to the current library
4. WHEN presets are managed, THE Filter_UI SHALL allow users to edit, duplicate, delete, and organize saved filter configurations
5. WHERE filter presets exist, THE Filter_System SHALL support sharing presets between users through export/import functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to filter photos based on AI-detected content, faces, text, and semantic similarity, so that I can find images that match specific creative or technical requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis is available, THE Smart_Filter SHALL provide content-based filtering including detected objects, scenes, and activities
2. WHEN face recognition is enabled, THE Filter_System SHALL allow filtering by specific people, number of faces, and face detection confidence
3. WHEN OCR data exists, THE Filter_Engine SHALL support text-based filtering with full-text search and keyword matching
4. WHEN semantic search is active, THE Filter_System SHALL enable similarity-based filtering using reference images or descriptions
5. WHERE AI confidence scores are available, THE Smart_Filter SHALL allow filtering by confidence thresholds for all AI-generated metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a professional photographer, I want to filter photos by comprehensive EXIF and technical metadata including camera settings, lens information, and shooting conditions, so that I can analyze my shooting patterns and find technically similar images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EXIF data is available, THE Filter_Engine SHALL support filtering by camera make/model, lens specifications, and all technical settings
2. WHEN camera settings are filtered, THE Filter_System SHALL provide range-based filtering for ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and focal length
3. WHEN technical metadata exists, THE Filter_UI SHALL display histograms and distribution charts for numeric filter values
4. WHEN multiple technical filters are applied, THE Filter_Engine SHALL support complex queries like "ISO > 800 AND aperture < f/2.8"
5. WHERE shooting conditions are recorded, THE Filter_System SHALL enable filtering by flash usage, white balance, and exposure compensation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a travel photographer, I want to filter photos by location data, temporal information, and geographic relationships, so that I can organize images by trips, locations, and time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPS data is available, THE Filter_Engine SHALL support location-based filtering with radius, address, and coordinate-based queries
2. WHEN temporal filtering is applied, THE Filter_System SHALL provide date ranges, time of day, season, and relative date filtering options
3. WHEN location hierarchy exists, THE Filter_UI SHALL enable filtering by country, state/region, city, and specific landmarks
4. WHEN trip organization is used, THE Filter_System SHALL support filtering by automatically detected or manually created trip groupings
5. WHERE geographic relationships exist, THE Dynamic_Filter SHALL suggest related locations and enable "photos near this location" filtering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a photo organizer, I want to filter by user-defined metadata including tags, collections, ratings, and custom attributes, so that I can leverage my organizational system for efficient photo discovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user metadata exists, THE Filter_Engine SHALL support filtering by tags, collections, ratings, and favorite status
2. WHEN hierarchical tags are used, THE Filter_System SHALL enable filtering by tag categories and nested tag relationships
3. WHEN collections are filtered, THE Filter_UI SHALL support both manual and smart collection filtering with rule-based logic
4. WHEN ratings are applied, THE Filter_Engine SHALL provide range-based rating filters and comparative operators
5. WHERE custom attributes exist, THE Filter_System SHALL support filtering by user-defined fields and metadata extensions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the filtering system to automatically identify and index all available filterable attributes from existing photo libraries, so that users can filter by any metadata present in their collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo library is indexed, THE Filter_Engine SHALL automatically discover and catalog all available metadata fields
2. WHEN new metadata types are encountered, THE Filter_System SHALL dynamically add them to the available filter options
3. WHEN filter capabilities are queried, THE Filter_Engine SHALL return a complete schema of available filters with data types and value ranges
4. WHEN libraries are updated, THE Dynamic_Filter SHALL refresh available filter options and update value distributions
5. WHERE metadata standards vary, THE Filter_System SHALL normalize and standardize common metadata fields across different sources

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the filtering system to provide real-time filter suggestions and result previews, so that I can efficiently refine my search without waiting for full query execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users type in filter fields, THE Filter_UI SHALL provide auto-complete suggestions based on available values in the current library
2. WHEN filter criteria are modified, THE Filter_System SHALL display result count estimates without executing the full query
3. WHEN complex filters are built, THE Filter_Engine SHALL validate filter logic and highlight potential conflicts or empty result sets
4. WHEN filter performance is critical, THE Filter_System SHALL cache frequently used filter combinations and optimize query execution
5. WHERE filter results are large, THE Dynamic_Filter SHALL provide progressive loading and result streaming for responsive user experience
