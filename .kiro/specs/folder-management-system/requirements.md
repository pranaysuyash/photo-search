# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Folder Management System enables users to configure and manage photo directories within the Photo Search application. This system provides flexible options for adding photo sources, from default system locations to custom directories and comprehensive system scanning, ensuring users can easily access their entire photo collection regardless of storage organization.

## Glossary

- **Photo_Search_System**: The main Photo Search desktop application
- **Folder_Manager**: The component responsible for managing photo directory configurations
- **Directory_Scanner**: The service that discovers and indexes photos within configured directories
- **Default_Location**: Standard system directories like Pictures, Desktop, Documents where photos are commonly stored
- **Custom_Directory**: User-specified directory path for photo storage
- **System_Scan**: Comprehensive search across all accessible drives and directories for photo files
- **Photo_Index**: The database/cache of discovered photos and their metadata
- **Watch_Service**: Background service that monitors directories for file system changes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a photo enthusiast, I want to easily add my photo directories to the application, so that I can access all my photos without manually navigating to different folders each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the folder management interface, THE Folder_Manager SHALL display current configured directories with their status
2. WHEN the user clicks "Add Folder", THE Folder_Manager SHALL present three options: default locations, custom directory, and system scan
3. THE Folder_Manager SHALL validate directory accessibility before adding to the configuration
4. WHEN a directory is successfully added, THE Directory_Scanner SHALL begin indexing photos in the background
5. THE Folder_Manager SHALL persist directory configurations across application restarts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a casual user, I want to quickly add common photo locations like my Pictures folder, so that I can start using the app immediately without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Default Locations", THE Folder_Manager SHALL display a list of standard photo directories for the current operating system
2. THE Folder_Manager SHALL include Pictures, Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders as default options
3. WHEN the user selects a default location, THE Folder_Manager SHALL verify the directory exists and contains photo files
4. IF a default location contains no photos, THEN THE Folder_Manager SHALL display a warning but allow the user to proceed
5. THE Folder_Manager SHALL show estimated photo count for each default location before adding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an organized photographer, I want to add specific custom directories where I store my photos, so that I can maintain my existing folder structure while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Custom Directory", THE Folder_Manager SHALL open a native directory picker dialog
2. THE Folder_Manager SHALL validate that the selected directory is accessible and readable
3. WHEN a custom directory is selected, THE Folder_Manager SHALL scan for supported photo formats recursively
4. THE Folder_Manager SHALL display directory path, estimated photo count, and total size before confirmation
5. IF the directory contains subdirectories, THEN THE Folder_Manager SHALL ask whether to include subdirectories in the scan

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a power user with photos scattered across my system, I want to perform a comprehensive system scan to find all my photos, so that I don't miss any photos stored in unexpected locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "System Scan", THE Folder_Manager SHALL display a warning about scan duration and system resource usage
2. THE Directory_Scanner SHALL search all accessible drives and directories for supported photo file extensions
3. WHILE the system scan is running, THE Folder_Manager SHALL display progress with current directory being scanned and photos found count
4. THE Directory_Scanner SHALL respect system permissions and skip inaccessible directories without errors
5. WHEN the scan completes, THE Folder_Manager SHALL present a summary of discovered directories with photo counts for user selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple photo directories, I want to see the status and manage my configured folders, so that I can maintain control over which directories are being monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Folder_Manager SHALL display each configured directory with its current status (active, scanning, error, offline)
2. WHEN a directory becomes inaccessible, THE Folder_Manager SHALL mark it as offline and display an appropriate indicator
3. THE Folder_Manager SHALL provide options to remove, rescan, or temporarily disable each configured directory
4. WHEN the user removes a directory, THE Folder_Manager SHALL ask for confirmation and explain that indexed photos will be removed from search results
5. THE Folder_Manager SHALL show total photo count and last scan date for each configured directory

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with changing photo storage, I want the application to automatically detect when photos are added or removed from my configured directories, so that my photo library stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Watch_Service SHALL monitor all configured directories for file system changes
2. WHEN new photo files are added to a monitored directory, THE Directory_Scanner SHALL automatically index them and update the Photo_Index
3. WHEN photo files are removed from a monitored directory, THE Photo_Search_System SHALL remove them from search results and clean up associated metadata
4. THE Watch_Service SHALL handle directory moves and renames by updating internal path references
5. IF a monitored directory is moved or deleted, THEN THE Folder_Manager SHALL notify the user and offer to update or remove the configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to exclude certain directories from scanning, so that I can prevent the application from accessing sensitive or irrelevant folders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Folder_Manager SHALL provide an exclusion list where users can specify directories to skip during scanning
2. WHEN performing any scan operation, THE Directory_Scanner SHALL respect the exclusion list and skip specified directories
3. THE Folder_Manager SHALL include common system directories (temp, cache, system folders) in the default exclusion list
4. THE Folder_Manager SHALL allow users to add custom exclusion patterns using wildcards or regular expressions
5. WHEN a directory is added to the exclusion list, THE Photo_Search_System SHALL remove any previously indexed photos from that directory

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with large photo collections, I want to see progress and be able to control scanning operations, so that I can manage system resources and understand what the application is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE any scanning operation is in progress, THE Folder_Manager SHALL display a progress indicator with current status and estimated completion time
2. THE Folder_Manager SHALL provide a pause/resume function for long-running scan operations
3. THE Folder_Manager SHALL allow users to cancel scanning operations with confirmation dialog
4. THE Directory_Scanner SHALL process directories in batches to avoid overwhelming system resources
5. THE Folder_Manager SHALL display scanning statistics including files processed, photos found, and processing speed
