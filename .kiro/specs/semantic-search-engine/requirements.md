# Semantic Search Engine - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an advanced semantic search engine that powers intelligent photo discovery using AI-powered natural language queries. The system leverages multiple embedding models (CLIP, OpenAI, Hugging Face) and advanced indexing techniques to provide fast, accurate, and contextually relevant photo search results.

The search engine serves as the core intelligence layer of the photo management application, enabling users to find photos using natural descriptions, visual similarity, and complex multi-modal queries while maintaining offline-first operation with local AI models.

## Requirements

3. WHEN I use complex queries with multiple concepts THEN the system SHALL understand compound descriptions and weight relevance appropriately
4. WHEN I search in offline mode THEN the system SHALL use bundled local models without requiring internet connectivity
5. WHEN I perform similar searches THEN the system SHALL return consistent results with reproducible ranking
6. WHEN search results are returned THEN each result SHALL include confidence scores and similarity explanations

6. WHEN I repeat similar searches THEN the system SHALL learn from my behavior and improve result ranking over time
7. WHEN queries are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide clarification options and alternative interpretations

### Requirement 5: Advanced Filtering and Faceted Search

**User Story:** As a photographer organizing my work, I want to combine semantic search with precise metadata filters, so that I can find exactly the photos I need using both content and technical criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply metadata filters THEN the system SHALL combine them seamlessly with semantic search without performance degradation
2. WHEN I filter by camera settings THEN the system SHALL support ranges, specific values, and equipment-based filtering

4. WHEN I filter by people THEN the system SHALL integrate with face recognition to find photos of specific individuals
5. WHEN I apply date filters THEN the system SHALL support flexible date ranges, relative dates, and event-based grouping
6. WHEN I use collection filters THEN the system SHALL search within specific albums, tags, or smart collections
7. WHEN multiple filters are active THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on filter impact and result refinement

### Requirement 6: Search Performance and Optimization
