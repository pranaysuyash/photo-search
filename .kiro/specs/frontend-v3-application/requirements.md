# Frontend V3 Application - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the modern React-based frontend application (V3) that provides the user interface for the photo management system. The frontend leverages React 18, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui, and modern web technologies to deliver a fast, accessible, and intuitive photo management experience.

The V3 frontend serves as the primary user interface, connecting to the comprehensive FastAPI backend to provide semantic search, face recognition, photo organization, and advanced management capabilities through a polished, responsive web application.
