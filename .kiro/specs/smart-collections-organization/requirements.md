# Smart Collections and Organization - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an advanced smart collections and organization system that provides intelligent, rule-based photo and video organization. The system leverages AI analysis, metadata, and user behavior to automatically create and maintain dynamic collections that adapt to content and user preferences.

The smart collections system builds upon the existing enhanced smart collections infrastructure to provide powerful automation, intelligent clustering, and advanced organization capabilities that help users maintain well-structured media libraries without manual effort.
