# Intelligent Content Discovery - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an intelligent content discovery system that uses advanced AI and machine learning to help users discover, rediscover, and explore their photo collections in meaningful and serendipitous ways. The system goes beyond traditional search to provide proactive content surfacing and intelligent recommendations.

The intelligent discovery system leverages user behavior, content analysis, temporal patterns, and contextual understanding to create personalized discovery experiences that help users connect with their photos in new and meaningful ways.
