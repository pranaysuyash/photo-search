# Workspace and Multi-Directory Management - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive workspace and multi-directory management system that enables users to efficiently work with multiple photo collections, projects, and directory structures. The system provides unified management across different storage locations while maintaining performance and organization.

The workspace management system builds upon the existing workspace infrastructure to provide seamless switching between photo collections, project-based organization, and flexible directory management that adapts to diverse user workflows and storage configurations.
