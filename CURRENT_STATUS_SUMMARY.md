## Recent Accomplishments

Today we successfully completed the **Photo Editing Interface Implementation**:
- Integrated existing ImageEditor component into main application
- Connected to existing /edit/ops API endpoints for all editing operations
- Added editing functionality to Lightbox component with prominent "Edit" button
- Implemented basic adjustments: crop, rotate, brightness, contrast, saturation
- Added before/after preview toggle for visual comparison
- Implemented non-destructive editing with full revert capability
- Added batch editing operations to BatchOperations component

This fills a critical gap in functionality and brings our feature completeness from ~38% to ~42% of total planned features.

## Next Immediate Priorities

Based on our audit, the next 5 tasks to implement are:

1. **Search History Feature** - Fundamental UX improvement for revisiting previous searches
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Cheat Sheet** - Help users discover keyboard shortcuts
3. **Filter Presets** - Save and apply common filter combinations
4. **Boolean Search Operators** - Enable AND/OR/NOT for precise searches
5. **Grid Micro-Animations** - Small visual enhancements for better perceived quality

## Strategic Direction

With the photo editing module now complete, we've addressed one of the most critical missing pieces. The app now has:

- ‚úÖ Complete search capabilities
- ‚úÖ People/faces recognition
- ‚úÖ Collections and organization
- ‚úÖ Ratings and favorites
- ‚úÖ Batch operations
- ‚úÖ Photo editing (NEW)
- ‚úÖ Export/sharing (basic)

The next phase should focus on enhancing search capabilities, improving user experience through UI polish, and implementing batch workflow enhancements that power users need.
