# Review & Intent-First Augmentation: World-Class Frontend Rebuild Plan

Date: 2025-10-02  
Reviewer: Automated Intent-First Assistant  
Source Plan: `WORLD_CLASS_FRONTEND_PLAN.md`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The existing plan is **ambitious, well-structured, and comprehensive** across UX, performance, architecture, and delivery sequencing. It establishes a modern, parallel-rebuild approach with strong visual + interaction aspirations (Apple/Google/Lightroom parity) and clear phase cadence.

However, several **critical augmentation areas** are recommended to de-risk execution and sustain long-term evolvability:

- Missing **observability & runtime analytics architecture** (RUM, error taxonomy, perf timelines)
- No explicit **design tokens governance & theming evolution strategy** (e.g., multi-brand, accessibility variants)
- Lack of **ref integrity & interoperability plan** with existing `webapp` (shared store migration, API drift protection)
- Insufficient **performance budgets enforcement mechanics** (automated CI gates, diff-based tracking, regression detection)
- **Accessibility work is back-loaded (Phase 6)** instead of integrated shift-left
- **No experimentation platform spec** (A/B infra, guardrails, sampling strategy)
- Missing **data mapping parity checklist linking backend domain models → UI types** to avoid silent divergence
- Under-specified **offline & resilience strategy** (stale-while-revalidate boundaries, degraded mode UX patterns)
- No **threat modeling or supply-chain hardening** (npm dependency policy, integrity scanning, CSP strategy)
- **Test strategy** doesn’t explicitly bind test classes to architectural layers (feature, store, hooks, UI contract)
- Lacks **progressive enhancement & low-memory/mobile constraints** definition

These gaps—if unaddressed—raise risk of post-launch performance drift, hidden UX regressions, and maintainability friction.

## 9. Suggested Architecture Adjustments

| Area              | Adjustment                                                                    | Rationale                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Design Tokens     | Introduce `tokens/` with `core.json`, `semantic.json`; build to CSS vars      | Enables multi-brand + automation            |
| API Layer         | Codegen OpenAPI → `src/generated/api` (no manual edits)                       | Prevents drift, ensures types stable        |
| Feature Modules   | Add `index.ts` export surfaces enforcing limited public API                   | Avoid cross-feature deep imports            |
| State Stores      | Introduce factory pattern + tests per store                                   | Enforce deterministic state evolution       |
| Error Handling    | Central error mapper (`mapApiError(e) => DomainError`)                        | Uniform UX & telemetry classification       |
| Offline           | Introduce `lib/offline/strategy.ts` with SW event hooks                       | Documented caching boundaries               |
| Performance Hooks | `usePerfMark(name)` wrapper around `performance.mark/measure`                 | Quick instrumentation consistency           |
| Analytics         | `analytics/events.ts` typed event catalog + `track<T extends EventName>(...)` | Compile-time safety                         |
| Experimentation   | Abstract `getVariant(experiment)` + fallback logic                            | Avoid ad hoc usage & inconsistent bucketing |

## 10. Testing & Quality Strategy (Augmented)

| Layer             | Tests                                      | Tooling                      | Phase Start    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Types/Contracts   | OpenAPI type generation diff test          | openapi-typescript, vitest   | 1              |
| Units             | Pure utils, hooks, store reducers          | Vitest                       | 1              |
| Components        | Key UI + interaction snapshot + a11y       | RTL + jest-axe               | 2              |
| Integration       | Search flow, grid virtualization accuracy  | RTL + mock server            | 2              |
| Contract          | API schema compatibility, error mapping    | Dredd / custom               | 2              |
| Performance       | Photo grid render time under dataset sizes | Puppeteer/Playwright perf    | 2              |
| Visual Regression | Critical layout (grid, lightbox, forms)    | Playwright + percy-like      | 3              |
| Resilience        | Network flakiness, offline case replay     | MSW + Playwright             | 3              |
| Security (Static) | Dependency + secret scanning               | trivy, eslint security rules | 1              |
| Accessibility     | Axe per component + page audits            | axe-core, pa11y CI           | 2 (continuous) |

Definition of Done (per story) must include:

- Type-safe (no `any` added)
- Unit tests for new logic
- Storybook entry (if visual component)
- Axe: 0 serious violations
- Size impact justified if >2KB gz added
- Telemetry events follow schema

### 13.2 Typed Analytics Event Catalog

```typescript
// src/analytics/events.ts
export const events = {
  SEARCH_EXECUTED: {
    version: 1,
    schema: {
      queryLength: "number",
      filtersApplied: "number",
      latencyMs: "number",
    },
  },
  GRID_RENDER_COMPLETE: {
    version: 1,
    schema: { photoCount: "number", durationMs: "number" },
  },
  LIGHTBOX_OPENED: {
    version: 1,
    schema: { source: "string", preloadCount: "number" },
  },
} as const;

type EventName = keyof typeof events;

type EventPayload<N extends EventName> = {
  [K in keyof (typeof events)[N]["schema"]]: (typeof events)[N]["schema"][K] extends "number"
    ? number
    : string;
};

export function track<N extends EventName>(name: N, payload: EventPayload<N>) {
  // Validate keys at runtime (optional)
  // Dispatch to analytics provider
}
```

### 13.3 Size Limit Config Example

```json
// package.json (fragment)
{
  "size-limit": [
    { "name": "initial", "path": "dist/assets/index-*.js", "limit": "250 kB" },
    {
      "name": "vendor-react",
      "path": "dist/assets/vendor-react-*.js",
      "limit": "95 kB"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "size": "size-limit"
  }
}
```

### 13.4 ESLint Boundaries (Example)

```json
// .eslintrc.cjs (fragment)
{
  "plugins": ["boundaries"],
  "settings": {
    "boundaries/elements": [
      { "type": "features", "pattern": "src/features/*" },
      { "type": "components", "pattern": "src/components/*" },
      { "type": "lib", "pattern": "src/lib/*" }
    ]
  },
  "rules": {
    "boundaries/element-types": [
      "error",
      {
        "default": "allow",
        "rules": [
          { "from": ["features"], "allow": ["lib", "components", "features"] },
          { "from": ["components"], "allow": ["lib", "components"] }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

## 14. Alignment with Intent-First Philosophy

| Principle                     | Application                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Investigate Before Rebuild    | Reinforces API schema diffing + parity matrix to ensure no silent regressions            |
| Preserve Value While Evolving | Parallel architecture + migration scoreboard protect existing user workflows             |
| Measured Optimization         | Performance budgets + instrumentation ensure improvements are evidence-driven            |
| Layered Responsibility        | Boundaries lint + generated types maintain clarity between feature, infra, and UI layers |
| User-Centric Outcomes         | Added metrics (task abandonment, error class rates) keep focus on experiential quality   |

## 15. Summary Closure

The original plan is a **strong foundation**. Incorporating the above enhancements converts it from an execution roadmap into a **resilient, observable, evolvable product platform** capable of sustaining premium UX over time.

Focus Immediately On:

1. CI + budgets + schema generation
2. Shift-left a11y/testing gates
3. Observability & analytics taxonomy
4. Design token governance

With these embedded early, later phases (polish/testing/launch) shift from remediation to continuous validation—dramatically reducing risk.
